1,1,md1957,"One more for tonight. What's curious isn't Firaxis' actual response regarding *Civ 6*'s new DLC. But rather how, despite the statements coming from the devs themselves, leave it to Eurogamer to shoehorn politicizing anyway. Hell, the article opens with this bit of agitprop and fearmongering:

>The United Nations published a report last month that warned without  drastic reforestation efforts and reductions in carbon pollution by  2030, our planet will soon be facing an irreversible global catastrophe.  
>  
>And yet, about 300 miles away from where I sit writing this, [a company has just restarted gas fracking](https://web.archive.org/web/20181121143602/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-46075799)  for the first time since it was banned in the United Kingdom in 2011.  Incredibly, this fracking began exactly one week after the UN report  made headlines across the globe.

>  
>Climate  change is unavoidably a political issue and it's also one at the heart  of Civilization 6's next expansion, Gathering Storm.

Notice how it takes more than a couple paragraphs *before the author even hands the proverbial mike over to Firaxis*. Not to mention, this:

>I pressed both developers on whether they felt Gathering Storm had a  responsibility to inform players on the topic of global warming, given  the current divide between the scientific community and certain  political leaders. They seemed hesitant to say anything too definitive  in response.  
>  
>""We know things are happening to the globe and we  know this is the way that science is pointing to how things are  happening,"" said Shirk. ""We want to reflect that and let the players  choose the direction they want to play the game.""  
>  
>""It's certainly a  very topical discussion right now,"" said Beach. ""While we were working  on this, Kilauea was erupting in Hawaii, we were having flash flooding  on the east coast and Hurricane Florence was hitting. It was certainly  something that our team could get engaged with.""  
>  
>Not much of an answer there, but I'm hopeful the expansion itself will have more to say.

4,4,Gizortnik,"I was watching the devs talk about this on their upload yesterday and I couldn't help but be struck at how this seemed to only be a continuation of the whether and climate effect that were present in their outstanding spin off game: Alpha Centauri.

Climate was a major factor in that game because a) the planet literally fought you with mind worms, locus, fungus, and sea monsters in order for it to try and achieve sentience, b) they implemented a significant climate model.

They were talking about the effects of flooding, and volcanoes, sea level rise, melting ice caps, and even the evil ability to intentionally pollute the environment for your own benefit. Alpha Centauri had most, if not all of that. [Like, say I'm a brutal capitalist/industrialist Morganite.](https://youtu.be/24OXzIRIiMQ?t=76) If I want to fuck over those [Peace Keeping surrender monkeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY57ErBkFFE) what I can do is build submersion facilities to keep my bases from flooding, and put it near higher ground preferably. Go to the edge of my territory and elevate the terrain high enough to alter rainfall patterns on everything to the east of me, thus decreasing the Peace Keepers food output. If I build a few condensers, I can make their air less humid, lowering their production again. I can turn their green pastures into a desert. Then I build a few thermal boreholes and and watch the planet respond to this by melting the icecaps and sinking a few of their colonies with rising tides. Then I can watch as they fail to have enough military units to fight off the inevitable swarm of mind worms that will attack everyone (and hopefully I survive too). Oh, and I can also make rivers by drilling to aquifers.

Now besides proving the fact that SMAC is just fucking amazing, it wasn't politically forced although it does have a more ""90's liberal"" sway to it (the right aligned factions seem a little more likely to be crazy: nutty bible thumpers, aggressive industrialists, survivalist gun nuts). The effects of climate were just an extension of a very complicated and fascinating gameplay environment

Like normal, all Civilization has to do is copypasta some of what they did in SMAC and they will have a fine addition to their game. You can put political philosophy in your game, just be sure to represent it genuinely.... like SMAC.",2018-11-21 16:44:11,20,,,,,

I kinda was hoping they would make a pollution thing but have more smaller scale polution things [relatively] like maybe polluted rivers, acid rain, that type of stuff... Maybe that was too much mechanically to add.  But the thing that it seems to be ONLY global warming specifically seems weird... when there is at least an obvious but completely left out flipside that would be mechanically interesting like global cooling at LEAST which makes it feel a bit political that they focus ONLY on that specifically.

I think the actual driver for climate change is and always has been the sun and over the 20th century we have seen many dramatic spikes in sunspots and a very strong series of solar cycles that match well the warming and cooling trends you see in the global residual (this is especially obvious when you use the earlier series numbers before they started tweaking them).

But we are approaching a grand solar minimum.  And it looks like one that might be very deep - like Dalton or Maunder minimum level.  If the solar magnetic field drop off -> cosmic ray increase -> aerosols from ionization trails hypothesis is correct -- over the next few decades we could see cooling.

It also gives you a baseline of politics. The Peacekeepers are *literally* UN globalist lefties by 1999 attitudes. The modern globalist left is much closer to [The Human Hive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO_xh7xIabk). The Hive was an interesting concept. Like, start with absolute pragmatism; assert that the survival of the society must be the absolute end goal. Recognize that the 0% risk option for keeping society alive is through collectivism. Now, put turn this concept up to 11 by using Nihilism and Confucianism to legitimize absolute collectivism *as a spiritual imperative*, linking society, the state, and religion as the same entity. Fascism and Communism *try* to do this with the idea of the state as the essence of the spirit of the people, *and* as a moral actor, more important than that of the individual. The Human Hive goes much further. It's as if the writers for SMAC were reading Nitzche and said, ""With the 'God is Dead' argument, Niztche presents the argument that man must somehow become overman with personal responsibility at his center, or make the state his new God. What if someone found a way to make the latter *work*?""

The Globalist Left are making *much* more collectivist arguments than they've previously made. They're no the Human Hive, but I'd bet money that if you asked them if the Human Hive was a good, even inevitable, idea, they'd say yes.

But, there's a terrible price to pay for such collectivism.

The original hockey stick study was not a prediction, so you can't expect it to come true, because it referred to the present and past, not the future. That study didn't contain the word ""predict"" or ""prediction"".

The study was based on recent measurements for the present, and on indirect reconstructions for the more distant past, where we didn't have direct measurements.

In any case, in 1999, the year that study was released, it was showing an estimated 0.8 Celsius degrees recent temperature increase until 1988, compared to the reconstructed 1000 year average for the northern hemisphere.

And since the trend for the previous 900 years until 1900 was downward, the absolute change over the last 100 years was even larger, about 1 degrees Celsius. Tough luck if the hockey stick shape triggers you, because that's exactly what it looked like:

https://i.imgur.com/o0vgESH.png

And since 1998, in the last 20 years, we added another 0.55 degrees Celsius to that 1 degree Celsius since 1900, so we are now at about 1.5 degrees Celsius total increase for the northern hemisphere, so the hockey stick shape is even more obvious now, because the lower part of the stick is now 50% longer than 20 years ago.

You can find detailed graphs from NASA, based on actual measured data for the last 240 years here:

https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/

The one with separate data points for each hemisphere is in one of the collapsed sections at the bottom.

So, what more do you want? Maybe God to come out of the sky and tattoo the damn hockey stick graph on your arm and put his signature under it?

The only notable capture plants do is in their tissues which is relatively short *in a forest* compared to what we need it to be because once they die the formerly captured CO2 is released in aerobic decomposition.

There's a couple reasons for that - the first and biggest is that solar energy output seems to have stabilized somewhere around 1950, though you're right that it was increasing before that. The second is that the global climate is a system which generally seeks equilibrium for reasons related to energetics and entropy, so increased solar output on a temporary basis (which is what we're seeing, since energy output seems to have stabilized post-1950) wouldn't necessarily lead to a long-term upward trend of global temperatures.

Cold records aren't very important (as are for the record temperature records) when studying mean average of temperature. You could argue in same way that ice ages never happened, because there were temperature spikes (as much as +15 C) .

>[I already responded to that comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9z3vqo/ethicssocjus_eurogamer_civilization_6_gathering/ea7hvkw/).

If that's your argument, then you just made plainly obvious you haven't read that study (or any other for the record - there are like 25 of them now, all supporting the general conclusions of the MBH9\[98\]). 

The most ""outrageous"" scientific claim that was associated with the study was that the '98 was the hottest in 1000 years (and was later retracted to 500y), which is, totally unimportant thing in grand scope. And it didn't even came from the study, but from IPCC TAR (which actually coined the hockey stick). 

Another valid criticism was absence of earlier data covering MWP, which was absorbed into later studies, confirming the general findings yet again. 

So yeah, MBH9\[89\] wasn't perfect and had some flaws, but wasn't wrong either in it's conclusions and it didn't make any of the claims you're attributing to it, that mostly came from sensational MSM, in part fueled from IPCC reports.

It is a political issue. Climate Change and environmentalism often comes from the left-wing and promotes predominantly Socialist solutions. Food for thought:

\- How come there's never a national vote on that and those deals and agreements simply get imposed on the populations by people they haven't elected?

\- How come the only solution to saving the Earth is...paying more an more taxes and banning more and more stuff - while politicians and celebrities still fly around in their private jets and don't practice what they preach? It's like the modern version of the medieval letters of indulgence.

\- The vast majority of ""green-tech"" companies are subsidized by the state. Politicians, senators etc. invest heavily in their stocks and sell them right before the company files bankruptcy, making hundreds of millions in the process thanks to insider trading. See Washington D.C. politicians and their investments in solar industries.

\- Why do the same leaders and organizations promote mass migration from the 3rd world to the 1st world, where the carbon footprints of the migrants will skyrocket? Isn't that contraproductive when you want to reduce CO2 emissions?

\- How come Climate Change science is predominantly state-funded? Isn't that a conflict of interest, if the only solution seems to be more and more taxation and government intervention? It's basically a bribe.

\- According to doomsday scientists the Maldive Islands should have sunken by October last year. Spoiler alert: They haven't. I wouldn't cancel my holidays there, either. The ice caps haven't melted, either. Antarctica had record ice levels in 2016/17. Are you telling me the global oven of climate change only has top heat?

\- CO2 levels have been way higher in past ages, for instance when dinosaurs roamed the earth. Guess they either paid a gazillion of taxes or hid their highways, factories and SUVs pretty well. CO2 is basically plant fertilizer. The lowest possible threshold for plant growth/existence is around 150ppm CO2 if I remember correctly. Currently we've got around 390ppm. The average ppm in a real greenhouse is around 800-1500ppm. CO2 is not a pollutant. Remember when ""One day politicians will tax the air you breathe"" was still a joke? Well, it's real today.

\- The Vikings in the Middle Ages settled on the coast of Greenland. Their survival was only possible because they could grow wheat there. Yes, on Greenland. It's not possible anymore, today and the last time I checked the Vikings didn't build highways and SUVs. What does it tell you?

\- How come skeptics get labeled ""climate change deniers"" and people, sometimes even celebrities are calling for silencing their voices, either by censorship, legal actions (for criticizing and doubting their views - are you kidding me?) incarceration, or violence? Just google Bill Nye. This is like medieval blasphemy laws.

But I know you're not stupid. I know you'll listen to a doctor. You know advil cures a headache and aleve is better for your back. You brush your teeth because you know it's good for you. Because science told ya so. You do so much in your life every day that was decided by science. But this one thing, because some talking head disagrees with it, is something you'll put your foot down on?  

  

It's like Pluto. If there were Oil on pluto and it mattered whether it was a planet or not because it would receive funding for exploratory mission, we'd be arguing whether pluto is a planet right now. Scientifically it's not. It was but it's not.  

  

Climate change isn't that different.   

  

Did you know oxygen causes a mass extinction once? When the first photosynthesis occurred there was nothing breathing oxygen. So it filled up the atmosphere and is responsible for almost eliminating life on earth.   

  

That doesn't mean anything today. That happened at a certain time for certain reasons. The same thing applies to climate change.   

    
CO2 levels have been generally at x level for however long. It's a  few several thousands of years, but I'm not going to get into any science to argue with you about it. Just hear me out.   

  

Let's say 200 years it's at x level. In the last 30 years. So mathematically, like lets say, make it 40 for easy math, 1/5th of the time those levels shot up! So if we were working on a boiler for 5 hours and someone told you, hey the last hour or so the temperature has been 200 degrees over where it's supposed to be, you're going to be like, eh something is probably wrong. That's a long enough time to say this isn't right.   

  

Part of the problem is that the first 4/5th of that time, the first 160 years is what took to create all that change in that last fifth. Which is kind of daunting when we're talking about the size of the earth and the amount of air in the atmosphere?  

  

Anyone who has worked with big things, really big shit, knows that a temperature or two might not be that big of a deal but if it's a continued trend, something isn't right and with big things it takes that much longer to turn it around, or pick it up , or turn it off for that matter.     

  

SO we're stuck at decision here. You can put your foot down and say, oh it's bullshit. You got every right to be wrong. But the risks of being wrong here are so great there is no second chance to fix it. That's what sold me. If we're wrong, and we don't do anything, and let it keep on as it is, there's no, oh shit we fucked this one up, and try to recorrect it.   

   

That's the strongest selling point. We even got a second chance on civil rights. Took 100 years but in the 60's we actually got black people the right to vote. And we kind of dropped the ball here or there before. Everytime, we've had a chance to say, eh, time to come around whether it was a left or right or whatever issue. 

  

You don't get that chance this time. You're telling me that you're with 100% certain, and will not feel an ounce of regret when you're wrong, for your kids or grandkids, if the earth actually doesn't look the same in 50 years? That you kids won't be able to go vacation in some pacific islands because they're under water. Or greenland won't have ice. Sea levels will rise, the oceans will acidify, and it has the potential to cause chain reactions that are insurmountable. They might not be that bad either. It's not an all or nothing thing. But it still doesn't mean we can be wrong about it. ",2019-02-19 21:41:52,1,,,,,

As you add CO2 et al to the atmosphere, it increases the amount of matter/mass/volume in the atmosphere so there’s more than can be heated, so overall heat energy in the atmosphere scales with the additional gas, but with thermal equilibrium, it won’t ever warm other molecules any more than any other molecule.

A tricky addendum: If there’s any infrared/radiative forcing measurement (controversial opinion: saying infrared is heat is like saying matter is heat, I don’t think it’s heat, I digress) it’s extra infrared that doesn’t warm much because of thermal equilibrium.

300,64,Finallymademypornalt,"Also please dont use disingenious facts. 95% of earths total history? Actually lets use that.

Earths old. Really really really old. So you could literally have had earth warmer for 95% of its time being around and had only single and simple multicellular life on it. Call it 4.5 billion years old. Call 95% of that 225million. Thats literally about as long as plants have been around. And since then the climates changed too. This is less about that the ckimate is changing and much more about how quickly the climate is changing.

Not that there wasnt life on earth before 225 million. There was but it was primitive plants. We also had molluscs fish amphibiand diaspids and by the late paleozoic which rounds out a mere 25 million years short of 225 million years ago, so 250 million years ago land based organisms.

It also ended with the largest extinction event ever that took life a whilento recover there. Possibly! Caused by greenhouse gases.

So since 95% of earths history buts us up to 250 million years ago im not sure how its relevant. Since we compare most of our climate science to the last 10,000 but go as far back as only 800000 years. But even then we have pretty good idea of how earths climate changed because it matches geological records and oceanopgraphy and paleology work. This isnt just climate wcience. It includes a ton of science from many different disciplines. 

That history too though shows us what a warmer earth looks like. So 30 million years ago theres no sea ice and oceans are 100 meters higher. 100 meters higher is quite a bit. Any beach youve been to in your life is probably gone. 

2.5 millian years back less ice 20 meters higher and thats the last time it went higher than it is now. Also no beaches youve ever been to would be around. This isnt just a save the earth. I live on an island sure but i also want to preserve the qualoty of life i have here for future generations.

You know the earths temperature changes for a ton reasons right?

So earth spins around the sun. If thst varies at all you end up with warmer or colder seasons.

The earths wobble, since it spins on its axis, contrinutes to warmer or colder periods. But generally attributable to shorter time frames again like seasons.

 Wikipedia citing a culture history of climate describes cool summers and mild rainy winters. Which  kind of sounds like higher CO2 levels but doesnt explicity state that.

But they do state during Augustus reign the temperature was at least 1 degree Celsius high than mid 20th century.

Im not saying there isnt validity toward looking in the past and saying well look at this or look at that. But you cant cherry pick individual  moments without including a broader historical context.

We could say Ancient Rome starts give or take 750 bc. Ends 500ad. You could maybe extend that through late antiquites till napolean conquered but whatever and the whole split between eastern and western but that had multiple emperors ruling multiple areas.

My point is call it 1200 years maybe? 

Our Ice Qge ended 11,700 years ago. Since that ice age temperatures have rose 4 to 7 degrees.

Some estimates put it at 5 degrees in about 5000 years.

So give or take during romes rise and fall you had maybe a degree a lil more in change over 1000, 1200 years.

This century. By the end of it were looking at a guanteed 2 degrees of change and possibly as much as 6.

Thats whats different. And whats different than Rome? Oil. This is so painfully obvious it makes me wonder why this is even framed as a scientific debate and not one of sheer common sense.


So, to me, this isnt a left vs right thing. If the GOP used their fucking heads and acknowledged this Id be voting conservative damn near exclusively. And I wouldnt be alone. My generation has felt the ills of tons of debt through college and 08. And were working hard and worked hard through that. But we also grew up with more informarion at our fingertips than anyone else. So when you show me something scientifically proven, there isnt a debate.

Its also why youll probably see UBI backed by a younger cohort too. Because theres a lot to back it up. Combined with, to me, good fiscal policy. Welfare/workfare is broken. Take away all those benefits that already equate to however much. Give people cash and youll enable them. Youll also help kods through school and shit and give a snall cultural boon. 

After that I dont think you see anything go much further left besides celibate change if democrats keep holding monopoly over it. Every uear more and more of my friends start voting dem because ya know im worried the climate. I cant in good conscience keep ignorjng it with my vote. Or some similar line.

After UBI and if the GOP gets on board with ckimate science and eventually you dont want to be on the wrong side of history anymore, my generation 100% will be voting in a much kore divided manner. And Im not talking my generation necessarilly nationally. I mean us coastal college educated types. We will be the first to vote for our pockets if we can do so sensably and with a good concience. That shit doesnt need to be mutually exclusive.

I can also see value in some lefist policies and still believe in a fiscally conservative approach with decent oversight. Were a smart generation that grew up with more information in our pockets than most people older than us had probably been exposed to up until that point.

Shownme science show me data. Make sense. Dont treat me like an idiot. And dont pull some identity politics card either. Lol we all used to firmly sit in a libertarian mindset that afforded a not strict interpretation of it and recognized some large necessities the govt needed to manage. Largely until climate change. Were very much a generation that doesnt see the world so binary.

Some small factions with loud voices may make you think that. But the average person my age youll talk to wont buy into that bullshit.

And if you want to get into the science of how they chart out the earths co2 history over all that time let me know.

304,68,gkibbe,"Any simple spectrum sample from UV light hitting soil and bouncing back to the CO2, we know that CO2 absorbs the low frequency emissions of the UV light bouncing off the ground.

I understand the specific heat formula, but idk why you think its applies except to exacerbate the heating problem.   Since a high CO2 atmosphere does heat up more with the same amount of energy input then as CO2 rises the temperature will rise. This will be in combination with greenhouse effect that will ensure a higher energy input because of greenhouse gasses' ability to absorb more low frequency radiation. 

Even if you think that the greenhouse effect isnt real, and it is all explained by the decrease in specific heat capacity, then you should have the same out look, that the increased CO2 is warming the planet.

If you think that this the data is part of a massive left-wing conspiracy, please ask yourself one thing. Why would all these people conspire to invest in renewable energy with less harmful byproducts when the technology isn't even there yet and it's such a monumental task? Any investor would scoff at such an idea. Why not invest in the already massively profitable and entrenched oil, coal, and gas industries? Could it be because this is not some chance to chash in on somma dat sweet solar panel cash but actually a mad scramble for damage control? Since we're putting so much effort and faith into technology that either doesn't exist or is in early stages, that we're hoping that some day we'll have widely available, cheap, but most of all, clean energy?

Yes, there are problems with how we're trying to solve it. Because the solutions still have to be implemented within a human context, and that unfortunately means corruption is inevitable.

And companies now are content with just keeping the status quo because their profit margins doesn't benefit from investing in technologies that won't pay off for who knows how long. But if it means we can slow down, stop, or maybe even reverse climate change, so be it.

We are accruing more and more carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere every day. This traps more and more heat from the sun. The extra heat changes weather patterns and melts ice. The sudden changes in weather and climate are killing an incomprehensible amount of plants wildlife that are unable to adapt so quickly. It's not too complex a process.

As you can probably tell, I've had this discussion countless times before with countless people and every time it started with this: People like you hardly addressed/debunked any argument or point I made. Since there are also more than enough climate scientists, who credibly claim the exact opposite, who can we believe, then? The only way for laymen such as you and me to find out who's right or wrong is to use common sense and watch for incongruent behavior in politicians and media, who advocate for climate change. Is there any hypocrisy, any contraintuitive behavior on their part, any conflicts of interest, hints that something doesn't seem right or downright criminal behavior? You bet. 

Please explain the connection between climate change science and state funding and the tax raises due to climate change science. Isn't that an obvious conflict of interest?

How can you trust these people? I mean their actions aren't even congruent. One one hand they're advocating for Westerners to have less children because of climate change and on the other hand they're signing unrestricted migration deals with the 3rd world that go clearly against the will of the indigenous populations in the West? Where do you think that people from the 3rd world would have a lower CO2 footprint? In the 3rd world, or in the West? So if anthropogenic global warming is the biggest threat to mankind, wouldn't it be reasonable to stop immigration to the West altogether until the crisis is averted? Why are they enforcing the exact opposite, then, even against the will of the people that elected them (the majority of the West doesn't want any more immigration, google the polls!)? Does this make sense to flood the West with migrants where their CO2 emissions will skyrocket while the indigenous population with their abysmal birthrates is supposed to have less children at the same time? Whose CO2 footprint is bigger? That of a baby, or that of an adult? And which populations never get told to have less babies? C'mon, that's not rocket science.

Please pay attention to the ethnicity of the babies in the picture. It's not an accident or coincidence.

I already told you why green tech is booming. People want it to work (which is a reasonable thing to want), so it's easy to manipulate them because hardly any normal Joe Doe knows any technical details about it, which is why green tech gets pushed by media and government. Look at how many people are virtue signaling with their hybrid cars and green energy and whatnot. The politicians are appealing to your sense of pride and sell you a slice of moral superiority. They don't care about this planet, hence why they never tell you how this oh so clean stuff is being produced. See who subsidizes those firms and invests in their stocks before they cash out prior to those tax-sponsored companies filing bankrupcy. Don't get me wrong, it's great that we do research in that particular area. We should absolutely keep working at it and try our best to provide clean energy one day, but we're currently far away from producing anything efficient (other than water power, which is too little and not entirely unproblematic) and there's several reasons for that which I'm not going to dive into for the sake of brevity.
 
Less harmful byproducts? Excuse me? Do you actually have any idea how the ""green tech"" stuff is produced? Do you have any idea how the lithium required for electric cars is being gathered? Hint: It's everything except clean and green.

I get it. You are a compassionate human being which is great and I applaud you for it. The world needs more people like you, seriously. No sarcasm. In contrast to the ruling class you have something called empathy (and/or your own children), which makes you care about the future and well-being of your species and life on this planet as a whole. You wanna do the right thing, which is perfectly reasonable. Sadly this compassion and empathy is your Achilles heel. It's been turned against you by those who care only about the acquisition of wealth and power in the here and now and forge a narrative that appeals to your sense of pride and makes you believe so strongly that you're doing the right thing, that you don't even realize you're being manipulated and pillaged. Use your reason and common sense and ask yourself the difficult questions. Those bitter pills that are hard to swallow. Ask yourself: ""Qui bono-Who benefits?"", then follow the money. Or keep your blinders on and double down on your beliefs in an attempt to protect your fragile ego from the knowledge that you too have been fooled. ",2019-02-17 21:58:49,2,,,,,

With that said: no, I have not changed my mind about it. But you do bring up some good points. Like I said, our current ""solutions"" are not perfect and have their own drawbacks and the people implementing them have their own agendas and biases. But I believe there must be some cost assessment here and even though there will be pollution from lithium and other byproducts, even though the people we put in office that promise environmental reform have other goals in mind or don't intend on following up on those promises at all, even if there are potentially some scientists that are just in it for the grant money, I believe there will be a net good to come out of it all. Because that's how *all* human endeavors work. It's cost assessment and the negative aspects of any plan weigh into that. 

So I will continue to vote to subsidize green energy and increase grant award money for scientists who endeavor to study and solve climate change.

What data do you need on such simple mental exercises? It's not like I'm asking you to explain the string theory, or relativity. Where does one have higher CO2 emissions? In the 3rd world, or in the West? Simple question, really. But here is your data: https://planetsave.com/2014/06/01/worst-carbon-polluters-ever-map-timeline/ Can you please provide an answer now?

If climate change is the most imminent danger to all life on this planet, why are the governments pushing for more migration from low CO2 emission countries to high CO2 emission countries? Please riddle me this, Batman. They keep pushing it even against the will of the people who elected them. They even tell their populations to not have babies, for crying out loud while simultaniously importing millions of people from the 3rd world! The same overpopulated 3rd world, that never ever gets told to stop having babies. If you were in charge and climate change is the most urgent and imminent threat, would you still keep importing millions upon millions of people from the 3rd world to the West, where their CO2 emissions will undoubtedly skyrocket? Please, answer this. What else data do you need on such a simple question? Dude, it's not rocket science. You don't need pages upon pages of data to solve this puzzle. All you need is some critical thinking.

What horrible side effects you're talking about can we see today? The melting ice in the Arctic? Al Gore said in 2009 the Arctic ice caps may be gone in 5 years. Yeah, he kept it vague on purpose - he knew why. But try to imagine how the audience must have felt and what impact his words must have had on their minds: The sense of imminent danger approaching. 5 years countdown, tick tock. Do something now, or we're all doomed. And today, almost a decade later? The ice caps are still here and most likely will be. And Al Gore got paid obscene amounts of money for basically being the urine stained, toothless, smelly homeless guy on the corner yelling: ""The end is nigh!"". So far the only thing that's gone is your taxpayer money. Also, how come the Arctic ice caps are melting while the Antarctic shows record ice mass? How come sea levels haven't risen? Or are you talking about extreme weather? To assume there haven't been any natural disasters and other calamities prior to the industrial revolution is simply asinine. Weather's always been more or less extreme.

But I don't expect you to change your mind, even when presented with facts and here's why: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVkkLDAm8I4 He's talking specifically about people like you right at the 2 minute mark. This is Yuri Bezmenov, an ex KGB agent tasked with the subversion and infection of the West with Marxism and who later defected to the US. You can google the entire interview and it's like this guy predicted the future in 1985. Highly recommended.

You made it clear you're all in favor of more government coercion, willing to turn a blind eye to corruption for whatever ""greater good"" your ill-willed and corrupt leaders want you to believe in, and you don't seem to mind increasing the tax burden on an already massively indebted, overtaxed population. Do you seriously still think you're one of the good guys?

320,84,Finallymademypornalt,">hey even tell their populations to not have babies, for crying out loud while simultaniously importing millions of people from the 3rd world!

You know overpopulation is one of the causes of poverty. Immigration is necessary for an economy. You'll never have enough babies in a health economy to keep up with demand.

That's kidn of the snafu for any conservative who doesn't understand how immigration works. You need it for a growing economy with unemployment at 5% or whatever. And you generally want it to be fair and even and not done illegally. But true conservative economists will never actually be against immigration. They understand its value.

Here's the thing I'll impress upon you.

THere's no second chance for climate change. To reverse where we're at, carbon wise, will take years. The paris agreement says we're going to hit this much temperature increase by the end of the century. in order to prevent it from ebing that much more we need to do this and that. it's basically a deal to maintain the status quo.

There's no second guessing this. There's no take 2. THat's the biggest thing.

I live on Long Island. SOmething liek 6 out of the last 8 years ahve been the hottest on record, consecutively. Might be 4 out 6 and the other two that were'nt a part of that? Ranked 2nd each time.

Is that not lke weird? Ya know records don't get broken over and over like that. Otherwise it's just a trend. The polar vortex thing this year was because of a warmer artic. That sucked.

ALso great video btw. Russia has always been at the disinformation game for a long time. Reality is there's nothing a disinformation campaign can do, realpolitk wise, when the whole world signed onto Paris. The biggest losers in climate change policy, are oil companies with a carbon tax.  Which won't hurt the economy all that much.

I mean, come on, this isn't rocket science. That's big money.

Pentagon, and Mobil Exxon both acknowledge sea level rise. One as a national security threat. The other by raising their oil platforms.

As for impact of climate change. There's real debate there.  It could be apocalyptic shit. IT's not outside the realm of possibility. It's not likely but it's possible. As to your point about things happening slowly. Yeah, of course they do. As much as everyone points to Al gore's speech, no one ever says oh well, ya know they said coastal flooding would increase...Houston flooded this year. Is that not alarming? Areas are having their once every 50 year floods twice a year.

This happens, then that happens. One by one. Over years. But if we do see something that makes us worried and we say woha, hold up, I'm on board now, what can we do? By the time we say that at the 5th domino we already shit the bed.

I fish, I hunt, I woodwork. I use nature, and respect it. And I want my grandkids to as well. I want them to be able to enjoy the same beaches I did and to enjoy the same fishing spots I do. I don't want them to have to move off the Island I live on because of hurricanes or flooding.

Back to the impact though. Sorry, to me, the writing is on the wall. Maybe it's cause I live by the water. But anyway.

It can range from the kind of standard shit, ecological impact, which we should give a shit about, melting ice, which will raise sea levels, ocean acidification, and consequently warming of the earth. Now what impact will all those individual variables have, we can kind of gauge for the most part. What impact will they have altogther? It's much harder to say.

It really does range from losing some pacific islands and living with a much more temperamental mother nature and worst storms and some changed weather patterns to all out apocalypse level shit where we get inundated with floods, you end up with mass migration, and shit gets all fucked.   

   

edit: i'm sorry man, this is one thing, and I'm conservative, I just feel so strongly about. it's also a generational thing. as a younger guy it's really at the core of values.  

  

   that said,  I can't help but add there's a tinge of irony that someone who is conservative linking a russian video about disinformation. especially in light of an indictment linking stone to wikileaks.   

  

not to bring up all that shit. but my ship sailed a while ago with that guy. was never a fan.

321,85,Hackfraysn,"Bullshit. IQ is the biggest predictor of success in life. Look at all the poor places in the world and check the average IQ. Their environment is a product of their own, not vice versa. Also your argument doesn't make any sense. If overpopulation is responsible for poverty, shouldn't you tell the 3rd world to stop breeding like rabbits until they get back to sustainable population levels? Also how come those very same nations/people have always been poor throughout history despite no overpopulation?

No, we don't need immigration, especially not from low IQ areas. Look at Japan. There's a population decline of the indigenous people just like in the West. What happens is that the wages go up, people will be able to sustain their families on one job again, like they could in the 50ies, housing prices go down and the Japanese are automating whatever unskilled labor can be automated. The West on the other hand is importing billions of low education, low IQ people with sometimes absolutely incompatible world views and ideologies from the 3rd world. That's a recipe for disaster (as crime statistics confirm) because not only are you upping their CO2 output astronomically, you're also importing people who don't give a fuck about the environment. What good is a IQ sub 80 (some areas go as low as 50) migrant going to do for the economy in a highly technological, complicated first world? He's going to be a net-drain on the welfare system, just as studies have repeatedly shown. Are you aware that not even the Army hires anybody below IQ 81? You also didn't answer my question. I'm confused, are you more concerned about the economy than climate change now all of a sudden? What's it gonna be cause you can't have both.

The biggest losers are going to be the taxpayers in the West. How you can argue that the Paris agreement, which allows the biggest polluters like China and India to grab money out of the climate change pot, is a fair and sane deal, is beyond me.

anyway, wanted to add an apology for being a dick at times. it doesn't really entirely change how i feel about your specific feelings regarding race and IQ. But I strongly, strongly, and I swear to you I'm not this leftists idea you have, to really really reconsider that. Big time. 
  
IF not that, or perhaps both but that's asking a lot, climate change is another one you could at least challenge yourself on. Because I fear it's a much bigger threat than a few people equating the bell curve's conclusions as defining race with IQ.   
  
edit2: I'm no so PC that I'm afraid of hard truths. I very much, very very much, firmly believe in telling people the things they need to hear. And not doing so in a sugar coated manner. People need to hear things they need to hear to change. If you don't it takes so much longer to come around to the things that are important. Partially why I use the tone I do. There's no reason to sugar coat around race or climate change. 
  
So studying racial difference or group differences are important. Making claims or stating facts about certain things are important. 
  
But you need to be so so so soooooooo right. You need to be so locked tight with your science and need to really look at all the factors. It can't be even for a second open to criticism on method, or funding, or whatever. And it is easily on several fronts.

Frankly, I don't ever plan to use that disclaimer and think news outlets should stop giving it credulance by asking ""but what about the politics"" to civ6 devs about a mechanic that was here in past civ titles.

ANYWAYS. Sorry for the rant.
I believe there are certain in-game actions that increase a carbon emissions meter:


-Chopping forests

-Building mines

-Harvesting resources

-Building railroads

-Coal and oil dependent units

(Probably some other stuff I am forgetting)

Certain late game buildings will need ""power"" to properly work. You can build a coal, oil, or nuclear power plant to get power.
If you choose the coal and oil plants, you will make carbon emissions.

You can make buildings or improvements like geothermal powerplants, windmills, offshore windmills, and solar panels to generate power without contributing to climate change.

Of course, it is a worldwide mechanic so some diplomacy might be involved in making sure everyone is playing nice. Or not.

As the climate change/carbon emissions meter builds up, the ice caps can start to melt, making sea levels rice. Hurricanes can become more intense. The effects can actually be pretty damaging and can even ""sink"" whole city centers. You can build seawalls to mitigate sinking tiles.

I am not sure if it has been confirmed or not, but I hope they also add grassland tiles losing yields and turning to desert.",2019-01-04 13:39:42,38,,,,,

355,4,dantemp,"Removing forests, rainforests and marshes, as well as using coal and oil (and nuclear energy, for some reason) for power generation and other stuff (units, railroads, tunnels) will increase the CO2 levels. There are 4-5 levels of CO2 that have different effects. The effects are two kinds: It increases the chance of some natural disasters (like storms and droughts) and it raises the level of the ocean. Risen ocean level causes some tiles adjacent to coast to flood or even submerge. 

if you want me to I can elaborate on some of the points. I also suggest that you watch the last gameplay stream, the first part is about the Inca, but in [the second part](https://youtu.be/yLdaUkRnL2Q?t=2013) we see very late game Hungary play and there are some of the climate change effects visible, like a tile submerged under the ocean.",2019-01-04 17:57:08,2,,,,,
356,5,Riparian_Drengal,"First, there’s a website which tracks all the announced (and leaked) changes for civ, [well of souls](http://well-of-souls.com/civ/civ6_gatheringstorm.html). 

Luckily for you the devs have been more than happy showing off storms and the climate systems. There’s a few different kind of “storms”: Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Droughts, River Flooding, Blizzards, and Volcanoes Erupting. These all have a percent change of happening every turn. Now for climate change itself.

> what is actually gonna cause it

Anything that would contribute to climate change IRL does so in Gathering Storm. So chopping natural resources, woods, jungles. A big contributor is going to be using coal or oil. They’ve re-vamped the strategic resource system to be more similar to gold in that your generate it on a turn by turn basis into a stockpile. You can used coal or oil in power plants to generate power for your cities under the new power mechanics, or to maintain your later game units (tanks need oil to run, for example) 

> what it’s gonna do

First and foremost is remember that percent change for storms to happen? Well with each level of global warming, that chance goes up for every disaster other than volcanoes. The other big change from global warming is coastal flooding, where as it gets worst more and more tiles will be consumed by the ocean. ",2019-01-04 21:33:06,2,,,,,

Not that I care because I think it will be a super neat mechanic. I would love for total global population to play a factor too, so we can get some late game “saviors” that want to eliminate some metropolises to “save” the earth! ",2019-01-04 15:29:50,8,,,,,
