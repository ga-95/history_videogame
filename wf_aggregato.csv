After handing out a few warnings, issuing some bans, i feel like i have to remind you again to please follow our rules. Especially **Rule 2. ""No personal attacks, witch hunts, or inflammatory language""**

I know that there may not be a more volatile topic out there right now, but please at least try to focus on the thing that counts here at /r/Games -> Games! This is a video game, there are plenty of other subreddits where you can discuss politics.
 
If you absolutely can't help it, at least be so kind and take a deep breath before you comment and don't give in to the rage. Be a Sith elsewhere, don't let the hatred flow through you.

Generalising like that leads to dehuminisation - the 1% loudmouth swastika wearing fools don't represent an entire party. Beth have equated almost half the country as Nazi's with that slogan. That's ridiculous and inappropriate.
Beth are money machines first and foremost. They could care less about political statements.

I also think there is a big part of the outrage that comes from normal center or moderate Right wingers tired of being lumped in with Nazi's by the extreme Left. 

Those guys get emotional and see this as another attempt at that. Not actual Nazi's by any definitions but after being called that repeatedly they react as if they are. Many Nazi's are made that way. 

Just enjoy murdering Nazi's guys, just like I would enjoy commies(rare though) or zombies. 

Who cares if the edgy game devs are drawing parallels between Trump and Nazi's? Trump are many things but a Nazi he ain't but then again, hardly takes the fun outta killing overly black-and-white villains does it?

The slogans ""Make America Nazi-Free Again"" and ""Not My America"" are *clearly* trying to align trump's supporters to Nazis by using their phrases of ""Make America Great Again"" and ""Not My President.""

Say what you will about Trump or his supporters, they're *not Nazis*. Like, *literal Nazis*. I'm sure there's a few here and there but that's not exactly the ideology being propagated. I find it hard to believe that 99% of the controversy is coming from *Nazis* and not people pissed off that they're being treated as if they're somehow related to modern history's largest proponents of genocide.

Saying things like ""*I can't believe that this is a controversial topic*"" is frankly intellectually bankrupt from how blatant the messaging is.

ScienceMTP,"I'm pretty disappointed that Bethesda is taking the political route with their ad slogan here. Wolfenstein has always been about that over-the-top Nazi slaughter, because nobody that's completely right in the head supports actual Nazism. They've always been the easiest target to dehumanize because of the atrocities associated with them. There's nothing inherently wrong with making a joke out of a political slogan that's used by people you disagree with. However it's certainly distasteful in the current climate to use a politically charged topic to boost your ad campaign.

To those that say the slogan is simply coincidence, you're being rather silly. It's blatantly poking fun at MAGA. Even if, through somehow bizarre circumstance it wasn't intentional, it could easily be taken as such. If something as innocuous as a color scheme and a graphic design with the smallest of resemblance to a stupid meme can put Bungie over the coals, then it's rather hypocritical not to hold Bethesda to the same standards for ""accidentally"" making reference to a controversial political slogan to advertise their game.

CombatMuffin,"They aren't given the benefit of the doubt by people who actually read history but you also don't paint them in black or white either, if you do.

Calling someone a Nazi or a fascist these days is just a trendy derogatory term, which detracts of nuance. Understandably, that's how culture works sometimes.

My point is this: Nazism refers to a political party (and ideology of said party), and fascism to a political ideology and structure. Not everyone belonging to those was instantly bad, but most were in one way or another aiding a political movement that pushed for, and did, very bad things.

**Wolfenstein: The  New Order** had a pretty cool hidden theme within a theme, too. Someone who doesn't pay attention just focus on the Nazi slurs, and glorified Nazi killing: that was theme surrounding the *real* post war entertainment industry's depiction of Nazis. Watch war movies up until like, the 80's, and Nazi killing was always glorified, put on a pedestal...

...But there is also a theme about the main character, Blazckowicz. You'll notice that anything and everything he does, no matter how sophisticated, is an extension of killing Nazis or resorting to violence. He's a Nazi killing machine. You have a lot of narration about his childhood and thought processes throughout, and you can see he is a simple minded person, driven purely by impulse, and although he is talented at many things, he is useless unless he puts those skills at killing Nazis. Everyone around him is much more human than him, he is just there to kill Nazis. 

In a way, its kind of a reflection of the player. The player isn't there to make big decisions. He is just there to press a trigger and kill Nazis.

Yes, Nazism is bad and it should always  be resisted, but a man like Blazkowicz is useless without Nazis.

So maybe it's not about giving Nazis the benefit of the doubt, or giving them a free pass. Maybe it's about how bad glorifying violence itself is, regardless of the target (even if sometimes necessary). Maybe it is about being nuanced, so we don't turn into a Blazkowicz, because at one point or another, the Nazis and the war will be gone, and if all you have is a hammer, all your problems start looking like nails.",2017-10-06 18:02:00,31,

predalienmack,"""Nazis and people who oppose Nazis are the same thing!"" - many liberals, from both sides of the aisle, on reddit and in real life. Trump echoes the same messaging, without really going out of his way to condemn white supremacists and Nazis specifically, simply because he knows they are a *part* of his baseline supporters, rather than doing so on the principle that free speech is important (which is the little understood issue that liberals try to fall back on despite their lack of understanding of Popper's Paradox and the fact that speech is never really free of consequences). The argument that Nazis and Nazi-opposition are both the same is so tired and asinine. Potential genocidal oppressors and people who fight back against potential genocidal oppressors are not the same thing! People have the right to defend themselves against the rise of a genocidal ideology, no matter what society arbitrarily defines as legal or illegal! 

Antifa is a leaning that is about opposing fascism when it shows its face in the streets. It is not an organization and it does not have a specified set of tactics, whether they be violent or not. It is a historical movement that literally started with people opposing Nazis in the streets as they rose to power in what became Nazi Germany. Liberals ignored them and their warnings then, and, with liberals never learning a damn thing from history, they are back at it again with the condemnations of antifa now, which only serves to help fascism gain a platform for legitimacy. Any person who would ultimately be affected negatively if fascists took over (which is basically everyone except the most wealthy and privileged, who would likely benefit from fascists being in power) should identify with antifa and the cause behind the leaning. 

That doesn't mean you have to support direct violence against Nazis, as not every member of antifa is violent. However, any basic understanding of history reveals that violence is the most effective tactic to destroy Nazism before it festers and actually gains real political power, let alone after it gains power. 

However, I would add that the vast majority of people who oppose violence against Nazis just so happen to be people who have little to lose by Nazis gaining power, while people of color, lgbtq folks, Jews, communists/anarchists/socialists, etc. all understand the danger Nazis pose to their very existence if they are allowed to gain power and influence, whether that be in the state or in society as a whole. This is why antifa should be supported, even if elements who participate in it act without thinking long term about tactics or public image...because it is not a unified organization with universalized stances on different, outside of the obvious which everyone should be on board with: opposing fascism. The fact of the matter is that opposing a violent ideology with violence historically works. In the case of Nazi Germany, not enough violence was used until it was too late for millions of people, clearly. ",2017-10-07 10:40:51,1,

> Its an interesting cultural shift that leaves me curious. Nazi's used to be our prime baddies that we could take a shot at without a care in the world.

It's quite simple, ""Nazi's"" are no longer Nazi's, they are regular, normal and perfectly reasonable people who simply do not hold the ""correct"" political opinion. When people talk about ""shooting Nazi's"" in games now you can no longer safely assume they are talking about the absurd caricature of evil they once represented, now it could be your next door neighbor simply because he said immigrants should come in legally and we shouldn't just indiscriminately let anyone into the country (something that was just common sense till about 3 years ago...).

The cultural shift isn't interesting, it's actually quite banal. it's exactly what you would expect to happen when you foster an environment where name-calling with no logical backing is not only common place, it's considered perfectly reasonable action for a god damn presidential candidate of the united states of america. The word has not only lost it's impact for 99% of people, it's become pretty much synonymous with perfectly reasonable, everyday people. So now you are essentially talking about massacring everyone friends, their family, their neighbors, the nice old lady down the street who baked them cookies on the weekends. And what are they supposed to think when someone who was damn near their president called them a bunch of racist, bigoted, homophobic, everything-else-aphobic deplorable?

TL;DR - The world is now so fucking retarded you don't even know if talking about ""shooting nazis"" is a call for indiscriminate lynching of normal every day people or not anymore.

With that, I'm all about killing Nazis in video games. As for the downvotes? Maybe people are sick of getting called Nazis for having beliefs that don't even get close to lining up with socialist/fascist hybrid ideologies?

There is real tension in the United States right now because of people peddling the *notion* that their political opposites are cut from the same cloth as a political party in 1930s Germany that led to a dictator bent on world conquest, genocide of people considered less than human, rampant expansionist imperialism; all culminating in the most lethal conflict in human history.

I think what is going on in this thread is that some people are arguing that Bethesda are politicizing the game by using the MAGA slogan. Some people in this thread believe that Bethesda are comparing a nazi dystopia to the current Trump America. ""Not my america"" as in ""not my president"". ""make America Nazi-Free again"" as in ""Make america not being led by Trump again."" It's like Bethesda are implying that nazism is the next step after Trumps reign, which quite frankly would be a lesser comparison of Trump supporters and nazis. Not so strange that Trump supporters would find that a little offensive, right? 

Other people are simply calling the people who imply what I just wrote above nazis or nazi sympathizers, like you just did. I don't want to insult you or anything calling you stupid or narrowminded or whatever, but I would just advice you to see other's perspectives instead of calling them nazis.

Aztook,"...but these aren't real people, they are pixels on a computer, being overly evil scheming cartoony people.

WHy does this logic not work for other games of historical settings or villians?


Why is no one asking for Star wars to make the first order 'more reasonable'? I mean, they're blatantly based off Nazi Germany.

I mean this is a game in a setting were a tyrannical fascist government takes control of the world. I don't think it's going to be all sunshine and rainbows. Though to be fair its more sunshine and rainbows then the first game what with the concentration camps, mutilations, and various other gory aspects.


Also 


Once again


cartoony villains.


So I find this kind of silly, because this reasoning makes no sense at all. I can take into account that in real life Nazi Germany these were people who fell for the greatest trick of them all: Hope for a better future for their country. Thus they were willing to do anything for that better future. Follow various orders that were disgusting, but to them probably seemed needed.


So I'm still confused how this game, with literal Nazis, who are dressed up in uniform, marching, swastikas, guns, who have someone taken over the world, colonized the fucking MOOON, and has camps set all over the world, with the most over the top villians that even Hitler would probably ask them to take a chill pill, is linked to that?

>Only a member of the race can be a citizen. A member of the race can only be one who is of German blood, without consideration of creed. Consequently, **no Jew can be a member of the race.**

>Whoever has no citizenship is to be able to live in Germany only as a guest and must be under the authority of legislation for foreigners.

Ise the same reason why the ACLU will defend the rights of right wing groups to free speech, because that right belongs TO EVERY AMERICAN. 

America is not a thought police state, everyone has the legal right to hold and espouse whatever belief they want without physical violence being for to them. (With the exception of speech intended to incite imminent violence) 

And you should be glad of this, because if it wasn't so, we'd actually be LIVING IN a fascist state. Ironically, those groups that are attacking opposing parties are literally acting more like fascists than most of their opponents they are claiming to be fascists.

It may seem that way at first but then you actually look at the kind of people a group like Antifa calls Nazi's and you quickly realize it's not. Look at the Boston free speech event that was protested for example, they labeled it a Nazi event when there wasn't even a hint of any form of white supremacy, there were multiple jewish speakers in fact. Another example is the Evergreen college situation, you have a guy who dropped out of college to fight for civil rights, somebody who has fought against racism his entire life, even doing research on why it happens to help stop it and they labeled him a white supremacist Nazi because he said no to kicking white people off campus because it's racist (he's also a jew btw).

aristidedn,"> Defending Nazis means what exactly?

It can mean a broad range of things. Physically defending them against attack, defending their ideology as correct, defending their right to spread their ideology even if incorrect, defending their anger at how they are treated, defending policies intended to protect or give comfort to them, defending the institutions or organizations they rely on to organize, defending ideologies or groups so similar that you might as well be defending them directly, etc.

> Hating them but wanting to defend their Right to not be assaulted in public seems like a pretty centrist idea. 

Sure. I think that the left probably holds a near-monopoly on internalized understanding of the paradox of tolerance.

> Defending Nazis means going: ''Look the Nazis weren't perfect but they only wanted what was best for Germany, how bad can that really be?''

That's one thing that defending Nazis means. There are many, many other things that can be described as defending Nazis.

> I do not like that. That too me is more of a extreme Right wing thing than anything resembling Centrism.

Blows your mind, I'm sure.

>Free speech applies only to the state.

ARE YOU KIDDING? You are 100% wrong here. The state doesn't need the right of free speech, because at any time it has the FORCE to make sure it can say and do whatever it wants. The ordinary citizen does not.

>People do not have to protect free speech

They do because it's they're right to do so, because IT IS THEIR RIGHT. Rights have to be protected or else they mean nothing.

>first amendment is not a guideline for civilians to follow.

Your right, it's not a guideline, it's a founding document that gives American citizens the right of free speech.

>They're people supporting a group that directly advocated for the genocide of any undesirable people.

Ben Shapiro was called a Nazi, even though he's a Jew, and doesn't hold any of the same views as a Nazi (again, he's Jewish, I must repeat). I guess just because they said he is a Nazi I should believe them despite the obvious facts to the contrary? 

>Oh great, the people opposing nazis are the real fascists.

Fascism isn't solely a right wing phenomena, in fact most fascist states in history are arguably leftist ones, these states have killed MILLIONS of their own citizens.

Furthermore, I don't care what a group themselves, I judge them by their actions. No one should support a group that claims to oppose fascism yet by their very actions  would create a more fascist state if they succeed in their goals. 

It's the same reason no one thinks North Korea is a democratic state, even though they're called the ""DEMOCRATIC People's Republic of Korea."" In the same vein, a group that calls itself anti-fascist may not actually be against fascism, just the variety they don't like.

>Impressive considering just in your first paragraph you mention groups ""widely and erroneously"" using the term, then you go and do it yourself.

>Socialism is the doctrine of liberation for the working class

>The bourgeois is about to leave the historical stage. In its place will come the class of productive workers, the working class, that has been up until today oppressed.

""Nazis"" aren't magical beings. Today you got 70 years of people constantly pointing out the worst atrocities of the nazis. Back then they were just a political party to most people.

And soldiers followed orders. Some parts of the Wehrmacht had a part in the attrocities, others didn't. But you probably think all the nazis crimes were committed by the Wehrmacht alone. (spoiler: SA+SS weren't Wehrmacht)

> Allies tended not to do these things

LMAO of course they did. That shit happens in every war, you gotta be naive to think anything else. Heck, even in the US stuff like the Dresden bombings were pretty controversial.

>The Soviets were indeed the worst offenders but it happened nowhere on the scale of the Wehrmacht. Muh whataboutism

Yeah sure, Stalin of all people totally didn't murder over a million pow's. Oh wait, he did.

Right-wing terror has been the biggest form of terror in the USA for over a decade. White supremacists and edgelords pretending to be supremacists are a decent number.

What you're doing is ""I can't believe this exists. Therefore, I'm pretending it's not a big problem."" and it helps no one. It's usually either done by well intentioned people who can't believe it exists, or people purposely being disingenuous and pretending it's a lesser problem than it is.

Your statistics bout ""tiny tiny minority"" doesn't protect people. It's not helpful. In the scheme of things Nazi's are a small number, but they're also rising. And that small number is still very very dangerous. Not just attacks, but there ability to shape people's lives. http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a55695/white-supremacist-law-enforcement/

This is 2017... You can do Nazi salutes. You can express you think non-white people should be gone. You can post memes about concentration camps and you're still ""maybe"" a Nazi. Spencer has been outward about his beliefs and you're still so hesitant to call a Nazi, a Nazi. But you're quick to defend them as not a big problem.

Charlottesville was one of the largest white supremacist rallies  in decades. We witnessed armed militia march, we witnessed people mowed down by a supremacist.

Stop trying to hide it under the rug. 

In 30 years, you're sitting on the porch with your kids or grandkids... You'll be able to say one of two things: ""I helped the Nazis, I made them appear weaker, and lesser. I hid the threat."" Or ""I helped try to stop the Nazis. I spoke out against them."" -- What you say is entirely your choice with what you can live with.",2017-10-06 17:59:14,8,

It was indeed planned before Charlottesville, and they took pains to distance themselves from hate grouos. But Charlottesville was why there were so many there. The planned attendance increased exponentially for both the the protestors and the the counter-protestors. Additionally, that was the second ""free speech"" rally in Boston, with the first being organized by those who planned the second as well as other groups who DID attend Charlottesville.

As to Weinstein, the following quote is of interest:
>During the same month, professors also voted on and revised a â€œResolution on Faculty Development in Race and Equity,â€ a document that encouraged educators to â€œreflect on our learning about equityâ€ and â€œintegrate new learning about equity in our teaching practices.â€

After several revisions, 70 faculty members voted in favor of the resolution and only two voted against. One of the dissenting voices was Bret Weinstein.

https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=9722

Note that this link has a lot of stuff defending Weinstein, especially as one of his peers said some pretty awful things. But it can be placed into context when one learns the school had recently been threatened for being a ""communist, scumbag town"". 

Additionally, the ""Day of Absense"" that was the spark at Evergreen is a long-standing voluntary tradition.

Are they *strictly speaking* Nazis? No. And if that is all your point is, I agree and I concede that mislabeling people as Nazis is very bad.

But reality isn't open and shut and the people who made the news for these accusations are likely not good people who are worth defending *other than for their basic human rights guaranteed by the Constitution*. Their actions, intentionally or not, are leading to the spread of the alt-right in this country. And Charlottlesville showed everyone what the alt-right stands for.

The folks at Crimethinc have great response to this point in their ""Free Speech FAQ."" I'll quote it below, but I would recommend reading the whole document as well: https://cloudfront.crimethinc.com/images/rt9/rt9_free_speech_faq.pdf

>*The best way to defeat fascism is to let them express their views so that everyone can see how ignorant they are. We can refute them more effectively with ideas than force.*

>People donâ€™t become fascists simply because theyâ€™re persuaded by their ideas. Fascism claims to offer power to those who feel threatened by shifting social and economic realities. The fact that their analysis of these shifts are ignorant misses the point; do we need to cite examples of how dumb ideas have proved massively popular throughout history? From Italy to Germany to streets around the world today, fascists havenâ€™t gained strength through rational argument, but through organizing to wield power at the expense of others. To counter this, we canâ€™t just argue against them; we have to prevent them from organizing by any means necessary. We can debate their ideas all day long, but if we donâ€™t prevent them from building the capacity to make them reality, it wonâ€™t matter. Only popular self-defense, not simply debate, has succeeded in stopping fascism.

From https://crimethinc.com/podcast/58/transcript :

>Many pundits have repeated the idea that antifa is a â€œmajor gift to the right.â€ Furthermore, it is often argued that without antifa, the far right would simply wither away. In fact, the Alt Right grew exceptionally well before it faced organized street opposition. It is far from clear that the movement has grown in size due to the clashes, but there is abundant evidence that it has been hurt by them.After Yiannopoulosâ€™s February talk in Berkeley was cancelled, the resulting media glare brought attention to his unsavory views on underage sex. As a result, his book deal was canceled and he is no longer a sought-after speaker for the Right. The aftermath of Charlottesville may have broken the back of the Alt Rightâ€™s fascist wing. The street-fighting with antifascists caused the rally itself to be canceled. Afterward, the Far Right suffered many material losses: Nazi websites have been knocked off the internet; nationwide marches canceled; leaders have been arrested for felonies; and numerous digital platforms canceled accounts. Richard Spencerâ€™s AltRight.com sees Charlottesville as a major defeat and is now advocating the clandestine â€œleaderless resistanceâ€ strategy because they feel it is pointless to organize openly.Itâ€™s evident that public resistance works when confronting far-right groups, and antifa are not the left-wing terrorists despite how they have been portrayed. And so perhaps we should ask ourselves: why are so many mainstream media sources using dishonest methods to create a folk panic about antifa, and who benefits as a result?",2017-10-06 19:56:04,11,

Sinklarr,"Nazi Germany was based ideologically and politically on Adolf Hitler's writings. Since he was indeed the leader of the party and the country, he managed to implement his ideas fully, geared towards a systematic and methodic extermination of all people deemed 'inferior' (not just jews, but gypsies and non-straight people), so we can assume that Nazi Germany was in fact a good representation of nazi ideology. 

Any communist regime, on the other hand, rests on an interpretation of Marx and Engels' theory, and a political leadership that may believe the stuff they are saying, or they may think that communism is a good way to maintain or seize power for themselves. The ideas contained in the Communist Manifesto haven't really been put into practice, there has not been, in modern history, a fully socialist society, i.e. classless, moneyless and stateless. 

So, to compare a bit. Communism is a political doctrine that proposes that the workers assume control of the means of production, destroying the bourgeois state and privilege in the process. Nazism, on the other hand, was an ideology oriented to put all the resources and power of a state towards the extermination of human beings.",2017-10-06 13:14:16,18,

>Nazis want to commit genocide.

I would say this makes the question of who we call a Nazi extremely relevant.

In addition, I'm using the word thought crime in as literal a sense as I can. This has nothing to do with 1984. This has to do with someone saying that someone should be killed because they think something. Which I guess has something to do with 1984, but it's not a parallel drawn because of it.

In addition, if you look at the context of the thread you'd notice that the entire time I've been talking about the people painted as Nazis because they're conservative or endorse things that others might consider suspect. 

Saying ""Nazis want to commit genocide"" is ignoring the context of the discussion in favour of a straw man you get to feel good about. If you want to at least remain on tangent, are you saying we should kill people who want to commit genocide?

It feeds into the far right victim narrative and gets people in a with us or against us mindset that drives others to the far right. 

It's similar to the whole SJW infesting universities idea. Yes there are a few cases but it's nowhere near as widespread as the right likes to push.

What an absurd bar to clear. There was nazi imagery, salutes and chants, and yet larger group of non-nazis didn't call it out? Why didn't they didn't distance themselves from them or tell them it was too far? Being complicit with Nazis may not make you a Nazi but it doesn't make you a whole lot better or do much to help the general image of others. 

And if you want to play ""No True Scotsmen"" games, antfia is not a collective - its a very lose label and identity, so saying claiming attacks are being done by antifa is a broad brush in the same way you believe calling people Nazis is.

>Milo Yiannopoulos isn't a fascist, he's conservative.

Only to the untrained eye. One of the core features of fascism is nationalism. People like Milo attribute social problems not to structural oppression or the actions of the state but to the characteristics of people within social groups defined as outside the imagined community of the nation. Without blacks to blame for crime, Mexicans to blame for job losses, Jews to blame for the banking crisis, gays to blame for undermining the traditional family, SJWs to blame for a polarized political climate, and so on and so onâ€¦ we would actually have to look at capitalism, oppression, and state power to figure out why we have the problems we have today. Milo and others like him actively try to make people ignore those systemic issues and instead blame their problems and the problems of society on minorities.

>Pushing these people into tighter echo chambers will not persuade them out of their views. The Nazis do not need a large presence, people are being driven towards them by all the anti-white, anti-men rhetoric that is perpetuated all over the media now.

Resistance to fascism doesnâ€™t increase interest in fascist views. If anything, liberals mobilizing to defend fascists on free speech grounds increases interest in their views by conferring legitimacy on them. This plays directly into their organizing goals, allowing them to drive a wedge between their opponents using free speech as a smokescreen. By tolerating racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia, so-called free speech advocates are complicit in the acts of terror that fascist organizing makes possible.

If we used the same methods used in the Black Book to count the deaths caused by capitalism, we would come up with a similarily bloated number. 

Regardless, I think the difference between the systematic extermination of people, and a violent revolution in which many people are killed should be pretty obvious. Besides, many communists nowadays are revissionists that did learn from the terror and oppression that took place in the USSR and in Maoist China (this is why we have communist parties in bourgeois parliaments, something Marx, Engels and Lenin condemned strongly, as they thought that the only way to power is through revolution). Another difference is that, while nazism was fully implemented, communism has not ever been fully implemented. Never once has a stateless, classless, moneyless communist society existed in modern history.

No. By justice they mean that every worker owns themself, and the means that they use to produce. This just means that nobody can get rich by exploiting other people, and they have to work instead.

You don't have a very good understanding of those who side with antifa. Leftists don't want to punish people for doing well. They work to address the root causes of the inequality of outcome that you are referring to, causes such as institutional racism and the inherently exploitative nature of capitalism.

Well, in large part because theyâ€™ve been the most prominent militant anti-fascists since the beginning.

But fundamentally the reason for this opposition is because radicals also mobilize around discontent in society, but rather than offering false racist explanations and oppressive solutions, look at the root causes and promote solidarity among all people towards a freer world.

It's not defeated in the sense that it has been completely eradicated, of course not. But the volume of racists that America has seems to be no greater that a statistical inevitability of having an enormous population. In America, it is about as good as it has *ever* been for *any* country, but it's being ramped up as some kind of existential threat to the Republic. It isn't, it's fear-mongering, it's contributing to the increasing entrenchment of political tribes when that's the last thing America needs, and it's not even remotely one of the most serious issues affecting the nation today.

After the war we had a booming economy but around the 70s or so we started implementing neo-liberal economic policies which in turn led to the benefits of a booming economy slowly but surely getting pushed towards the already rich while the poor and middle class slowly started to suffer.

That culminated in the 2008 recession which in turn was fought with policies that demanded austerity which led to the rise of extreme right wing political parties all over the developed world. Here in the EU, Greece was the first sign of that and now we are back where we started.

To say that communists, socialists, and anarchists are ""as bad or worse than"" Nazis demonstrates your complete lack of understanding of those ideologies.

In general terms, those three ideologies aim for a free and classless society, and they do not inherently advocate for achieving that through violent means. Nazis ideology is inherently violent because it aims for creating an Aryan/white ethnostate, which can only be accomplished through genocide or other violent means.

Sure, there are many anarchists, socialists, and communists who believe that violent revolution will be needed to achieve their ideal society. However, the targets of that violence are the bourgeoisie, i.e. those whose livelihoods are built upon the backs and bodies of the working class. I myself do not advocate the murder of anyone or any class of people.

2 things I want to note.

> Not surprisingly, beliefs about the 2016 election and voter fraud were correlated with support for postponement. People who believed that Trump won the popular vote, that there were millions of illegal votes in 2016, or that voter fraud is not rare were more likely to support postponing the election. This support was also more prevalent among Republicans who were younger, were less educated, had less factual knowledge of politics and strongly identified with the party.

This is incredibly disheartening but also exactly what I expect out of the base the Republicans have built. Blind party loyalty regardless of how much it would destroy the country.

But.

> Postponing the 2020 presidential election is not something that Trump or anyone in his administration has even hinted at, but for many in his constituency, floating such an idea may not be a step too far.

grimbaldi,"> Nobody acquiesced.

Have you watched the 1972 film [Cabaret](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068327/), or the musical on which it was based, set in 1931 Berlin? There's a memorable snippet of conversation in it that goes:

> ""The Nazis are just a gang of stupid hooligans, but they do serve a purpose. Let them get rid of the Communists. Later we'll be able to control them.""

> ""But who exactly is 'we'?""

> ""Germany, of course.""

Later on there's a very [ominous scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0E3m47pOE4) featuring the Hitler Youth. Listen to what one man says to the other at the end.

The idea that ""nobody acquiesced"" is nonsensical. Historian Alan Bullock wrote that â€œ[t]he Communists openly announced that they would prefer to see the Nazis in power rather than lift a finger to save the republicâ€. The Catholic Centre Party failed to recognize the threat and continued to negotiate with the Nazis to protect their own interests. And the German Right, much like the Republican Party of today, chose to try to partner with the popular fascist rather than denounce him and strip him of power. Hindenburg and Papen had been opposed to Hitler but ultimately succumbed to pressure and appointed him Chancellor in a misguided attempt to control him. Look how that turned out.

In fact the entire history of Hitler's rise is a story of myopia, negligence, and acquiescence. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power):

> Both within Germany and abroad initially there were few fears that Hitler could use his position to establish his later dictatorial single-party regime. Rather, the conservatives that helped to make him chancellor were convinced that they could control Hitler and ""tame"" the Nazi Party while setting the relevant impulses in the government themselves; foreign ambassadors played down worries by emphasizing that Hitler was ""mediocre"" if not a bad copy of Mussolini; even SPD politician Kurt Schumacher trivialized Hitler as a ""DekorationsstÃ¼ck"" (""piece of scenery/decoration"") of the new government. German newspapers wrote that, without doubt, the Hitler-led government would try to fight its political enemies (the left-wing parties), but that it would be impossible to establish a dictatorship in Germany because there was ""a barrier, over which violence cannot proceed"" and because of the German nation being proud of ""the freedom of speech and thought"".",2017-10-07 11:36:55,1,

It's hilarious that you have no concept of what ""left"" is or history at all. He literally despised communism/socialism (you know, because he literally rounded up and killed all the socialist/communist parties in Germany). 

To quote Hitler himself:

>""The great masses of workmen want nothing else than bread and amusement; they have no understanding of idealism; and we can never count on being able to gain any considerable support among them. **What we want is a picked number from the new ruling class, who â€“ unlike you â€“ are not troubled with humanitarian feelings**, but who are convinced that they have the right to rule as being a superior race, and who will secure and maintain their rule ruthlessly over the broad masses""

What he is saying is literally implementing a class system. A class based system is literally antithesis to the core tennants of Communism/Socialism - that all have a say in the community and that they will be provided for/treated according to their needs.

Traditional values and hierarchies are strongly defended, if not revitalized against the encroaching forces of leftist progressivism.

This is exactly this issue, and it's telling (albeit wholly unsurprising) that this sentiment is being buried in this thread.

It's very easy to dismiss this when you're a firmly left leaning person - as I can only assume the majority of this sub is - who can be 100% certain that they're not the ones being referred to.

But for those of us on the other side, it's a little less unclear. Are they referring to legitimate, honest-to-god, armband-wearing *Nazis*, or are they using ""Nazi"" in the more expansive sense? I'm not surprised that to left-leaning people the answer is obviously the former because I'm assuming most left leaning people have never been sincerely accused of being a Nazi.

However, many of us on the right *have* been accused of being Nazis, even those of us (like myself) who hold *zero fascistic views*.

And so while it's easy for those on the left to handwave this away as nothing, those of us on the right have legitimate cause to wonder if this is a dogwhistle way of referring to garden variety conservatives as Nazis as well. Maybe that sounds alarmist, but the video game industry is notably left-leaning and it's *never* been easier for a non-fascist to be accused of being a Nazi than it is right now.

At the *bare minimum*, I'd argue the developers are capitalizing on all the ""punch a Nazi"" sentiment that's been going around. While I don't think there's anything wrong with that, the fact that ""punch a Nazi"" in many circles effectively means ""punch a conservative"" makes me think twice about this when I wouldn't otherwise.

Overall I'm willing to give the devs the benefit of the doubt, but I absolutely understand how normal, not-Nazi people could see this ad campaign and be thinking in the back of their minds: ""*They're not talking about me, are they?...*""

**In a more rational age this wouldn't be controversial, but unfortunately we do not live in rational times with rational people, so ""punch a Nazi"" doesn't always just mean ""punch a Nazi"".**

Hopefully this lends a new perspective to the situation and some people wondering how in the hell anyone has a problem with this ad campaign have some sort of an answer besides ""Nazis are mad"" because it's more complicated than that these days.",2017-10-06 20:40:12,15,

killbot0224,"Sure.

Your post is basically one big gaslight. 

Trump has basically made sowing division a strategy, for one. Bannon has stated that it *explicitly*.

The *actual* Nazis were not left wing. They weren't socialists. They used the word in their name for marketing, basically.

""Nazis/fascists had the media in their palm""

Yeah the ""left"" tilt of the modern media is not because the ""left have the media in their palm""

There is no government control of the media. The media is independent, and leans left largely because greater education and exposure lead to greater empathy, and right wing ideals (every man for themselves + social conservatismt + hard line law and order) run counter to that empathy. 

If you work in media, travel the world, read about the whole world, and know about how successful socialist programs actually are then it becomes hard to not want to push for more in America... Oh wait. Social security is already here (and is THE golden hands off program)  

One of the big scams of the right in America isn't just to prevent socialist programs from being started, but to sabotage any that are so they can say ""see? This doesn't work!"" 

Meanwhile Hitler's health care wasn't for everyone... It was for the whites. 

Jews got really fuckin lousy healthcare. 

Belief in collectivism is not a ""nazi ideal"" that somehow you must run away from. 

The real joke is that you just called liberalism a ""narrow ideology"" though. 

What's narrow about empathy, inclusiveness, collectivism, and social acceptance? 

Narrowness is disenfranchising voters, preaching intolerance against (take your pick), encouraging police to violently violate suspects' right. 

Being intolerant of the intolerant is not ""narrow"" 

Remember the last time people were ""tolerant"" of Nazis?

WikiTextBot,"**National Fascist Party**

The National Fascist Party (Partito Nazionale Fascista, PNF) was an Italian political party, created by Benito Mussolini as the political expression of fascism (previously represented by groups known as Fasci). The party ruled Italy from 1922 when Fascists took power with the March on Rome, to 1943, when Mussolini was deposed by the Grand Council of Fascism.

Preceding the PNF, Mussolini's first established political party was known as the ""Fascist Revolutionary Party"" (Partito Fascista Rivoluzionario, PFR), which was, according to Mussolini, founded in 1915. After poor November 1919 election results, the PFR was eventually renamed the National Fascist Party during the Third Fascist Congress in Rome on November 7-10, 1921.

The Night of the Long Knives (German:  Nacht der langen Messer ), also called Operation Hummingbird (German: Unternehmen Kolibri) or, in Germany, the RÃ¶hm Putsch (German spelling: RÃ¶hm-Putsch), was a purge that took place in Nazi Germany from June 30 to July 2, 1934, when the Nazi regime carried out a series of political extrajudicial executions intended to consolidate Hitler's absolute hold on power in Germany. Many of those killed were leaders of the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazis' own paramilitary organization, colloquially known as the ""Brownshirts"" due to the color of their uniforms. The best-known victim of the purge was Ernst RÃ¶hm, the SA's leader and one of Hitler's longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the left-wing Strasserist faction of the Nazi Party (NSDAP), along with its figurehead, Gregor Strasser, were also killed, as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis, such as former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and Bavarian politician Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who had suppressed Adolf Hitler's Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923.

Trump's a proto-fascist, Clinton's a neo-liberal that only wants to make the rich richer.

Well, Trump has a long history of racism. His dad was caught at a Klan rally in the '30s, implying there's a history in the family. In the '70s, he was sued for housing discrimination against black people. There's the ad he took out against the Central Park Five, and how he stood by what he said even after they were proven innocent. The comments against Mexicans, his pardon of Joe Arpaio, his refusal to denounce the KKK's support of his campaign. In short, there's a lot. I'm sure I'm forgetting stuff too.

I don't think Trump supporters explicitly support fascism. I don't think you guys all sleep with a copy of *Mein Kampf* under your pillows or anything. Fascism, though, is particular to the country it arises in.

The foundation is there. Over the past ten years or so, many, many people have begun to call out instances of sexism and racism in American society.

Being tolerated is not a right. Read up on what the 1st amendment actually entails.

You are not guaranteed tolerance from your fellow citizens. Protected from societal backlash. If you're a nazi, expect resistance.

And painting the left like they're all antifa is as ludicrous as painting all the right as Nazis.

The difference is... The Nazis are fucking Nazis. Banding together *against* them is to be expected, tho all their methods aren't necessarily laudable.

You have backed yourself into a corner on that one and cannot relinquish it.

Everyone outside can see it. Up north we're largely looking on appalled, and disappointed on your behalf. We knew he was a snake oil salesman. 

Puerto Rico knows it. Anyone who saw his comments to law enforcement knows it.

Trump is trump.

If you need to ask this question, we're already in trouble.

He takes all his trips to his own properties... where he charges the feds for accomodations.

He *openly promotes* his golf course, his hotels, etc from the podium.

He places greater importance on retaliating against criticism than on doing right (Puerto Rico)

He continually seeks to score cheap points with his base through twitter rants and insults rather than lead the country. (Rocket Man? Is it *trying* to antagonize NK?) HIs self-congratulation is endless.

Right Wing? John McCain if he thinks Trump upholds Right wing values?

> The man has done more in his first year than Osamba did in his first term.

What are his accomplishments exactly?

He has Congress, Senate *and* the Supreme Court... and they can't get a repeal of the ACA through. Took 3 tries to get a largely cosmetic ""travel ban"" through?

> Neo-Nazis don't even like him, so that's false. Again.

A joke of the highest level. 

David Duke, for one, openly encouraged his followers to support support Trump. That's how highly he thinks of him. Neo Nazis have been emboldened by his very existence, feeling *validated* by him. Richard Spencer (an open white supremacist) loves that Trump is in the big seat.

> He's not an opportunist

Except... he is. You don't have to watch long, or read much about his past to know it.

His MO has always been to do whatever he could get away with (his real estate career was founded on it), and he has an enormous ego. He wants to be president largely for the sake of being able to say he's president. He has no coherent ideology, but could only have made it as a republican, so he ran as a republican.

As for Tim Allen losing his show... Did I say the media didn't lean left? No, I didn't say that. I absolutely agree that the media leans right.

But you promoted an outright false equivalency of a *leftist* media compared to a government controlled media. That's an out-and-out lie.

As for Last Man Standing... it was popular but not a blockbuster. Its politics may not have helped, but it was hardly a shoe-in, especially when pay raises are expected around 6 seasons and ABC didn't own it

If ABC owned it, it may have continued. And if it was so great (and had a strong business case) then I'm sure they could have shopped it around and jumped networks.

> They have first amendment rights just like everybody else, though

They do. That's why the *government* doesn't stifle those rights. Counter-protesters aren't stifling free speech though.

BTW... actively encouraging owners of NFL teams to FIRE players who protest the national Anthem is *actively spitting in the face of the 1st Amendment.*

Your entire post can be summed up as being a bad orator.

The leftoid legacy media (LLM) will never report fairly on Trumpâ€™s good deeds and bigly heart.

Iâ€™ll assume you reading have seen the YT video of PRESIDENT TRUMPâ€™S live press conference, in which he perforated the usual suspects â€” rogue Derp Staters and the defanged and deteriorated shitlib media â€” with a rhetorical howitzer aimed calmly and even humorously at his targets.

As great as that Trump appearance could be fairly judged, there was an even better, and more important, video of him shot on the same day.

That appearance was Trumpâ€™s signing ceremony with WV coal miners, keeping his promise to roll back a burdensome and redundant Osamba regulation. It was an emotionally reverberating reminder of Trumpâ€™s big heart and why Heritage America loves him as their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAvbPPf-NPI

Trump has a genuine and sincere common manâ€™s touch. He may be a billionaire playboy President, but his heart is good olâ€™ boy and his soul salt of the earth. Heâ€™s a manâ€™s man and a ladyâ€™s man without the hoverhand, a Vince McMahon-schooled showman and now the true leader of a revolution we may not deserve, but need more than ever. PBUT.

On the subject of Trumpâ€™s speaking style:

My thoughts on Trump the extemporaneous speaker: Not a master rhetorician. Leaves killer points on the table too often. Can veer off on tangents.
And none of that matters. Why? Because the man has balls. BIG FUCKING BALLS THE SIZE OF BOULDERS. Thatâ€™s all it takes. All itâ€™s ever taken. Balls.
And one more thingâ€¦.candor. Balls & candor. The two are often seen together.

Friend objects,

Your wisdom is showing! Yet, as I agree with most of what you say, I must add that Trump is a master of one-liners, a RETORTICIAN if not a rhetorician as when I heard him say â€œlow-life leakersâ€ I burst out with laughter and enjoy his refreshing CANDOR.
Friend is absolutely right. My complaints about Trumpâ€™s speaking style were in fact â€œbackhanded insultsâ€, meaning they were really praise. Trumpâ€™s lack of polish is his great strength; heâ€™s candid, earthy, and funny, and that resonates with Americans even if it bugs snobby, conniving Acela elites. â€œRetorticianâ€. I like it.

Most people aren't claiming that election was stolen. Most are saying that Russia tried to influence the election and that they were partially successful. That's why it's of paramount importance that the matter is investigated and safeguards are put in place so that it wouldn't happen again.

And it doesn't happen just in the United States - Russia has also tried to meddle into elections in Europe. For instance Russian hackers infiltrated Emmanuel Macron's email just before French presidential election.

Obama did provide proof but nothing was enough for the conspiracy theorists, including Trump.

> vs this crap that has been going on for over a year and no evidence.

There is plenty of evidence of Russia's actions both in the United States and in Europe. Do you think American and European intelligence agencies are wrong?

Divide and conquer - that's what Putin is doing. Conquering isn't even necessary. Russians are beating United States and Europe in cyber warfare 6-0. Russia itself is much more resilient to information warfare because there's no free press to speak of.

I agree, but what is strange that again this became an issue when Trump won and not before, how come? Since the start of Cold War untill even today both Russia and US have propaganda in each others countries or borders. So this is nothing new, we do it to them they do it to us. However whole thing you said doesn't answer to what I was talking and that is Witch hunt about Collusion. There's proof in itself that DNC refuses FBI access to hacked servers that they are hiding something, and no one is investigating that.

No one is asking why Russia became more aggressive, but do remember of Russians expelling USAID and calling Hillary out for trying to overthrow them. Then Obama and EU trying to overthrow their allies, maybe this triggered them of being pushed in the corner?
I'm just being a realist here and I supported Obama, but not his encroching on Russia as I knew eventually they would retaliate.

Ok if Obama provided proof then that discredited Trumps claims and that's it.


Sure there's evidence of Russian CITIZENS doing hacking, but none about collusion. You remember anyone who as much as shook hands with Russians at some dinner was accused of collusion.

Maybe because it was taken down in its country of origin. And after it was taken down, an American bought it and shipped to US. Context matters. It wasn't erected by local officials - it just ended up in Seattle.

Czechoslovakians took it down - I've tried to repeatedly hone that point in but you and your friend just don't get it.

Let me put it this way - if some of those confederate statues ended up in eastern Europe after Americans took them down nobody would care. There's no context or history with confederacy in eastern europe.

We are talking about one specific Lenin statue that was imported to United states. You are trying to draw equivalence between that specific statue and confederate statues. There isn't any.

I already mentioned that people in the former Soviet Union states want those statues gone and that is what happened to the Lenin statue - it was teared down in Czechoslovakia because people saw it as a symbol of oppression. Even though it's part of their history, they don't want to be constantly reminded about Soviet Union.

After an American bought the statue and shipped it to US, it no longer has that same context - it's owned by private citizen and it's in private property. It's not there to remind people that they were once part of Soviet Union because that is not part of their history. And literally no one gives a shit what happens to that statue.

I mentioned how in Eastern Europe on the former Soviet Union States, people want to tear down and have tore down statues of Lenin et al. And that's understandable because to those people Lenin represents oppression. People who oppose are mostly Russians on both Russia and Russians who still live in those countries.

If you agree that those people have a right to demand those statues removed, I have a hard time understanding why confederate statues couldn't be viewed the same way - as a relic of oppression. Put some statues in museum and teach people what happened in Civil War and after.

There's no comparison to pyramids. There's no artistic or architectural value in those statues as opposed to pyramids. And as others have pointed out, current research is challenging the view that slaves build pyramids.

Just now, you completely failed to understand what I wrote - your seven buddies were demonstrating for the removal of the one Lenin statue you brought into this discussion. The weren't trying to preserve history - they were trying to make the same failed point as you did, that the single Lenin statue is equivalent to the hundreds of confederate statues. And that the left is being hypocritical because they're not demanding the removal of that single statue. But they're not equivalent.

Post after post, I tried to explain how the statue got in the US and how it was symbol of oppression in Czechoslovakia and how it was removed there. Hint: confederate statues in US are similarly symbols of oppression and there's nothing wrong to remove them as long as it happens lawfully.

Russia gives money to far-right movements across Europe and world. Russian hackers compromised Emmanuel Macron's email account right at the eve of French election and added false information and then made everything public. They were trying to help Marine Le Pen to win the election. Russians also tried to influence Brexit vote.

Russia is a direct threat to Western democracies and tries to undermine our election process and trust in the system. But since Trump takes everything related to Russia personally, he doesn't take the threat seriously.

Weighty issues of political philosophy. Genuinely probing questions about the conflict between various ideals and the relationships between them. 

Not petty, presentist partisanship.

Vampire: Bloodlines was political. The entire game was about a conflict between political factions and each faction had its own take on the ideal political order *for vampires* given the facts regarding vampire nature. That is political. That is substance.

BioShock and BioShock 2 criticized utopianism and argued that human nature is messy and complicated and prone to hypocrisy and opportunism and the lust for power. This makes a ""perfect world"" effectively impossible, or at least easily destroyed if just one thing goes wrong. That is political. That is a weighty issue in political philosophy. 

Transgender pronouns, transgender bathrooms, manspreading, media representation, online harassment, spelling mistakes in Presidential tweets, that's all trivial bullshit with no political substance or universal appeal. Its craven, stupid, shallow and so utterly small minded... It takes one geographically specific, chronologically specific, tiny issue and treats it like a sacred principle in political culture. Its politics *for parochial morons who can't see that they're in a tiny bubble*. Its the most fucking solipsistic shit.

Gryregaest,"This. To my understanding were some attempts at cooperation between American Nazis and KKK members early on, but the groups were very distrustful of one another and nothing much came of it. The KKK tends to be very xenophobic, and I doubt many of them would ever support a foreign invasion of their homeland, regardless of the color and racial ideologies of the invaders. Plus, while they were certainly nationalists, I don't know that they would buy into fascism like that. Whether we like to admit it or not, they seem rooted in individualist American values, and I don't see them toeing the party line, especially from foreigners.

One of the reasons fascism doesn't spread like communism does, is that it is heavily based on nationalism. It's hard to convince people to adopt your philosophy of in-group vs. out-group subservience to the state when your rise to power was based on characterizing them as the out-group. Especially so when they're already nationalists, and thus have their own in-group. For the Nazis to get real support from the KKK, they'd really have to make an effort to target them as a group, and make concessions for their ideals. This wasn't going to happen, since the KKK was already rapidly spiraling into irrelevance.


Of course, I wouldn't put it past occupation forces to co-opt a group, put collaborators in charge, and purge all the dissenters, so that the organization has the same face but is a puppet for the regime. But again the question would be why. By the 40s, the KKK was neither influential nor popular with the American people.

But as others mentioned, Nazis weren't super consistent with their values. Their values were honestly whatever supported the party that day. They talked a lot of Aryan-this and eugenics-that, but most of their allies were on their racial shit-list and most of their enemies among the western allied forces were on their approved list. They stuck to their ideologies when it was convenient, and abandoned them at a moment's notice when it wasn't.

electrotherobot,"I was thinking about this exact subject earlier today, but the truth is it's not complicated.

People aren't upset by the idea of killing 'Nazis', as we picture Nazis in WW2. It's just that the term 'Nazi', much like 'racist', 'bigot', 'misogynist', etc. have been so diluted at this point that people aren't sure what they mean anymore.

I mean, I think the vast majority of us can agree that killing Hitler is fun. But there are a lot of very vocal and influential people these days who *actually* seem to believe that, say, the president of the United States is a Nazi. Or that pretty much anyone who holds conservative views with regards to immigration or racial issues is also a Nazi.

I mean, I recently got branded a 'Nazi apologist' by a bunch of angry liberals simply because I suggested that sucker punching Richard Spencer in the head was not actually the right thing to do.

I have to say that, though my political leanings on social issues have traditionally been more leftist, the political left in 2017 is dangerously eroding the meaning of some very serious terms in an apparent attempt to justify violence and open hostility against anyone they disagree with.

It's really an icky situation, but it has led to people being uncomfortable with stuff like this Wolfenstein promotional material, because there's an increasing chance that the people they're marketing this game toward have, themselves been told that they're Nazis.",2017-10-07 00:58:08,53,

What people are taking issue with is comparing how people should react to the modern neo-nazi movement with how people should react to the fucking third reich.

What people don't like is jackasses making obnoxious comments saying that if you disagree with the trend of punching ""nazis"" then you also disagree with the violence in wolfenstein.

The game is about a military occupation of America by the original nazis. Comparing that to modern neo-nazis, a group which has always been weak and ineffectual, is asinine.

You're not making some edgy political statement by jerking off about how much you love killing nazis in a fucking video game.

Oh. Yeah. Wonder why he would ever want to direct media attention towards a game being sold by Bethesda. I guess it's just *too controversial* for him to not speak up. What a brave boy.

I suppose it's possible that Hines might be having a stroke? He's confused and thinks this is the *original* Wolfenstein and he's talking about violence in video games as a new concept?

Also, it's something that gets said a lot, but *holy shit* Americans really do enjoy some hardcore revisionism, don't they?

You don't really get to claim that fighting Nazis is a core part of your cultural identity when your nation was content to supply and sell to those Nazis for years before joining the war. The USSR, too - Truman was quoted as effectively saying that he was specifically aiming to prolong the war and make sure as many Russians killed Germans as Germans killed Russians.

How do you think the US so quickly rose to power after World War 2? You'd been racking up debts and leases from anyone who wanted to fuel a tank and march an army - or, I guess, any *other* reasons the Nazis might have had to start big fires with so much fuel - and you'd already started collecting, with interest, by the end of the war.

,"Well, Wolfenstein did release that ""Make America Nazi Free Again"" ad which subtly paints Trump supporters as Nazis with a turn of phrase. Maybe major game studios shouldn't be inferring that half the fucking country are nazis? 

Also, there's an element of self-fulfilling prophecy here. The VAST majority of the ""alt-right"" are not genuine Nazis, they're far closer to American Libertarians. BUT, every measure of their movement is met with opposition, calling them Nazis, now even game studios and Hollywood is getting in on it. SO, at what point do these people say ""fuck it"", and start rolling with a red arm band? They're gonna get called that shit either way. ",2017-10-07 18:15:44,3,

Couldawg,"People are being pretty ""cute"" about the message and the reaction. ""What do you *mean* this ad upset conservatives and right-wing folk? It's just about killing Nazi's!"" 

Come on. The VP for Marketing at Bethesda is undoubtedly skilled at crafting the message he so desires. He is also undoubtedly aware of the current political climate, and the tendency of ... ehem, *one side* to label everyone on the other side a Nazi. Also (undoubtedly) he is aware of the slogans used by those in the political arena. 

Bethesda took Trump's campaign slogan (""Make America Great Again"") took an explicit ""Resistance"" slogan (""Not My America"") and threw those into an ad for a game about casting out the Nazis who take over America. 

This ad was meant to tap into (exploit?) the anti-Trump rhetoric (hysterics?) of the day. That was the stated intent of the ad. To play coy and throw your hands up in shock now? That's being ""cute.""

,"The biggest problem with all of this; not this ad campaign, not what Nazis think, but the fact it's relevant. A story like Wolfenstein being as batshit insane as it is somehow has relevance in our current day. 

""Make America Nazi-Free Again"" and ""Not My America"" rings so true right now for a lot of people. You got the president of the United States simply going ""they ain't so bad"" when asked about neo-nazis and their rallies when they are a horrible, horrible group of people in a way is letting more of this minority to come to the surface, thus making it clear we actually do need to get rid of Nazi sentiment again. That fact is what makes this ad campaign so disturbing. A game about blowing up a bunch of Nazis and their shit that was written with zero intention to mirror real life in someway ended up doing so anyway. The fact the game's ad campaign has to actually state this combined with the fact above is what makes this fucked up.

Fuck the Nazis for being offended. I'd say getting the combined power of the Red Army and US military in every hole in 1945 would be enough of a lesson, but apparently not.

Also, props to the ad team on this. Amazing capitalization on the current political climate. Probably will get them a couple extra sales.

Even the White Nationalist movement has adopted language from the Civil Rights movement. 

If you are upset because someone stole a phrase then I think you should take a deep look at yourself, on any side of the political spectrum. Even then take the opportunity to be introspective, specifically because you are so upset over a video games marketing of all things. 

Beth took a well known phrase and made some clever marketing over it. They didn't call you a Nazi. And they didn't tell you to go beat up Trump supporters.

I can't in good faith get behind targeting people for their political beliefs, no matter how heinous or ridiculous. But, within the confines of a video game it's irrelevant because they're not real.

,"x-posting my own comment from /r/xboxone:

When they say something like ""Make America Nazi-Free Again"" it can be interpreted literally in the context of the game - liberating America from a foreign Nazi regime - and take the MAGA reference as a joke.

Another way to interpret this as a call to action against what the likes of AntiFA consider to be a Nazi - everyone to the right of them - and the MAGA reference as a reference to Trump, and an insinuation that he's one of those ""nazis"" they're referring to.

The difference between the two is very significant. The first one is a fictional scenario and the second one is a call to ideological cleansing. Murdering other Americans because of their ideology is profoundly un-american and goes against fundamental American values.

They probably had the first version in mind, but I hope you can see how some people might look at it and think of the latter interpretation.

Someone makes a game where you're killing communists (who historically have killed [almost an order of magnitude more than the nazis](https://i.imgur.com/eyUnc.jpg) so it's certainly fair game).

Their warcry is ""I fight for Her!"", ""Death to the white man!"", and ""From triggers to bullets!"" Then the final boss is their dear leader Mallory Wilton.

Typhron,"Nazi's seem to appeal to those who want to find strength (or presume strength) where it does not exist. Fine and dandy if it didn't carry the very real baggage of genocide and turning a generation on it's ear, but...well, here we are.

So it's very telling that more often than not, those who align/defend Nazis are fairly meek-looking people who are also afraid of their own shadow. Or anything that would threaten their view of the world. So of course anything remotely threatening looking will set them off. And they project. A lot.

...That being said (*and I* ***fucking*** *hate myself for actually playing Devil's advocate here*), we also live in a time where any cause, however political, can be co-opted for corporate interests in the literal worst way: as advertising. doubly so with game publishers who have *always* courted controversy, rather than sway from it or actually hang a lampshade on it.

With this tweet/trailer, one should note that the play on ""Make America great again"" is juxtaposed with the lesser known ""Notmypresident"" sentiment within the video itself. **This is less like courting controversy and more like a honeypot for the politically loud. And hey** ***just*** **like every other time this has happened in the past when it comes to gaming** (Dante's Inferno, anyone? Or how about Review Embargoing a good game so people are *expecting* it to be bad), ***it worked***.

I don't think anyone was trying to make a statement in a void. But I'm sure it was meant to be tasteless.

It's the alt right defining the conservative ideology and thus convincing normal conservatives that it's bad to kill Nazis in a video game.

So they make the connection that ""They call us Nazis, they want to kill Nazis, therefore they want to kill us"".

Conservatives have to confront the alt right because as I said, the alt right is becoming the new face of the republican party.

wetpaste,"I think, the real argument that these ""constitutional conservatives"" (as I've heard them call themselves) are trying to make is seeded from a few different points.

1) They argue that there is a tendency for liberals to (unfairly) conflate certain right-wing movements with fringe nazi movements. Right -> Alt-right -> white nationalism -> white supremecy -> nazi. There is a chain of association and name calling.

2) there is strong core belief that everyone should be free from violent action and have equal rights, no matter how vile their viewpoint is (going against the ""punch a nazi"" thing). I would say that the ACLU probably sides with the constitutional conservatives on this point.

They want to stick to their beliefs without being labelled as siding with nazis, but that doesn't happen. They see things like the ""Make America Anti-Nazi Again"" and it puts them on edge because, this is exactly the problem that they see with liberals, conflating their trump support as being a nazi.

Wolpertinger,"It's more the case that actual genuine honest to god white supremacists are becoming an increasingly influential and loud group within the right. These are people who keep getting caught talking about how subhuman jews are trying to destroy america and about how blacks are genetically inferior and naturally violent. Despite using typical neonazi rhetoric though, they all wring their hands and claim innocence because they are merely 'proud of their race' and are 'only' white supremacists, not nazis. They're pretty much spouting the exact same old nazi shit but they think that since they rebranded themselves that they can deflect from anyone who calls them a nazi.

Obviously, these people are not literal members of the no-longer existing political party in germany, but they've taken enough of their dangerous ideology that they need to be opposed firmly.

Obviously, most right-wingers aren't that extreme, but the problem is that they're being wishy-washy as fuck about it and either pretending to not notice that all these groups of supporters and big donors are /not/ massively racist, or flat out secretly supporting them.

Charlottesville could have been completely defused by Trump if he had just denounced the literal neonazis wearing swastikas who murdered someone, it's as simple as that. Instead he tried to deflect blame onto the counterprotesters of literally Nazis and imply that they were equally at fault.

The whole problem with tolerating neonazi and neonazi-like ideologies is that by ignoring them and looking the other way you just let them normalize themselves and gain more and more political influence. Even the actual nazis came in promising good things and had great PR at first, because they kept their most reprehensible beliefs quieter and toned down the rhetoric until they were in power.

Some of this is from memory so it's not perfect - but during the campaign Hillary tried to ""flip"" Trumps campaign slogan by implying ""Ameirca is already great"".  The general attempt fell flat and was largely forgotten.

This issue currently is the phrasing and what we can imply through political rehtoric.

Lets take the two messages ""Make America Great Again"" and ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" (the slogan in the game marketing).

Well if we take these two messages side by side - first and foremost - one is absolutely cribbed from the other - there is no disputing this.  And secondly, side by side, it adopts the same sort of ""stance"" as what Hillary's campaign attempted during 2016.  Imply making america great (again) was redundant.

If viewed from this framing it puts ""make America America again"" as the opposing stance against the message it's cribbing from - a ""correction"" much like what the Hillary Campaign tired.   If that's the case then the message ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" is challenging would place it by default on the ""other side"" - in this case ""The Nazi side"".

There is more to it than just the above but the above is a good general framing as to why it's disingenuous to write-off conservatives being upset about this as them de-facto trying to defend Nazis.

beldaran1224,"I want to address what you said about finding strength. The problem with what you said is that that is what motivated the actual average Nazi during WWII. They were disenfranchised Germans who were attempting to find a new sense of pride and power in the world. And they used that to commit genocide.

Those who feel disenfranchised are often drawn to such groups. But here's a couple other issues with your characterization.

One is that these groups are not meek. There is nothing meek about them. They protest, they take over public forums (both online and IRL) and they do act on their message of hatred with violence.

Two is a consideration of their actual power. They are disenfranchised in the sense that they are typically poor and uneducated, but are also young white men. The odd thing is that they're disenfranchised because of the former, but its the areas in which they are already dominate that they attribute the disenfranchisement to. Instead of attributing their poverty, joblessness, etc to issues like lack of education, discrimination based on legal past (how many ex-cons wear swastikas?), etc, they attribute it to their race and gender - the two areas in which they have a huge leg up in the world because of. So while they are among the disenfranchised in our society, they completely misattribute that and, instead of working to actually help themselves, only further victimize other disenfranchised groups. Because of this, I do not give them a pass.

If they were like so many Americans who falsely attribute issues in our country to immigrants or ""political correctness"" - if they were merely wrong, I could understand. But they aren't. They are loud and they are violent. And their vocal minority only validates those views in the minds of others who feel that same disenfranchisement. They are a violent group. They align themselves with those who number among the most hateful and awful organizations in history. And they do so knowingly. They do not get a pass. It doesn't mean I don't understand - I do. But I do not forgive, excuse or in any way cut them slack.

I feel very strongly that while we should understand what causes such groups, and while we should try to solve the root problems, we should be very clear, very adamant, very *unwavering* in our disavowal of their actions and theories. It's important that we do not contribute to their rhetoric, that we do not, in any way,  give the impression that we agree with it. That's part of what makes this so difficult: they have turned to such rhetoric because they are not being heard, but we cannot allow their voice to dominate the conversation and further victimize other disenfranchised groups.",2017-10-07 03:11:07,18,

The reality is likely that the statement isn't controversial at all, but the prospect of it being controversial is in itself controversial.

If...that makes any sense?

Trump actually does this masterfully (intentionally or not is a different matter).  You can make relatively neutral statements until you're blue, and people will normally ignore them.  But all you have to do is insinuate that the statement you're making is somehow defied by a party (any party, but particularly one that isn't yours), and suddenly there's hundreds of people up in arms about who could possibly disagree with such a statement.  It works surprisingly well, and you can say the most mundane shit too, but as soon as you insinuate that there's a disagreement, you have people rally to your side.

Hamakua,"Not the person you replied to but I'd like to share a perspective and what I think is going on and where all the outrage is coming from.

Some of this is from memory so it's not perfect - but during the campaign Hillary tried to ""flip"" Trumps campaign slogan by implying ""Ameirca is already great"".  The general attempt fell flat and was largely forgotten.

This issue currently is the phrasing and what we can imply through political rehtoric.

Lets take the two messages ""Make America Great Again"" and ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" (the slogan in the game marketing).

Well if we take these two messages side by side - first and foremost - one is absolutely cribbed from the other - there is no disputing this.  And secondly, side by side, it adopts the same sort of ""stance"" as what Hillary's campaign attempted during 2016.  Imply making america great (again) was redundant.

If viewed from this framing it puts ""make America America again"" as the opposing stance against the message it's cribbing from - a ""correction"" much like what the Hillary Campaign tired.   If that's the case then the message ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" is challenging would place it by default on the ""other side"" - in this case ""The Nazi side"".

There is more to it than just the above but the above is a good general framing as to why it's disingenuous to write-off conservatives being upset about this as them de-facto trying to defend Nazis.   Conservative offense in this case, at least from what I can see - isn't being taken because people are attacking Nazis - it's because people are attacking conservatives being lumped in via campaign slogan cribbing *with* Nazis - when for over the last year they've been painted as Nazis 24/7 by their political opponents.

Nazism is political stance. Not a race or nation.

Is this the strawman the alt-right are trying to use now? If you're anti-Nazi you're anti-German?

The German people are utterly ashamed of their past. Holocaust denial is illegal in Germany, the Charlotsville neo-Nazi marches are also illegal in Germany. Nazi symbolism and propaganda (or Volksverhetzung) is illegal too. The German people can speak for themselves - they don't need you to misrepresent them for your own nefarious purposes.

Your argument is garbage and founded in sheer ignorance and false information. Unsurprising coming from an alt-right person, where reality and facts must be thrown out the window in order for you to hold your views.

In the 50s and 60s, these views were quite popular, relevant, and influential. It couldn't be ignored, so a dialogue was necessary between people who wanted the dominant role in the social order (racists or egalitarianists).

In 2017, it's not generally acceptable to be a racist except in your own little racist subculture. They are at the bottom of the social order, and their status at the bottom is not in question. Because it's not in question and there is no legitimate conflict, there is no dialogue necessary. They are irrelevant. They should be belittled and mocked to discourage people from seeing those views as a reasonable thing to hold.

By opening a dialogue you bring into question their status at the bottom of the social order. ""Surely if they have a voice then they're worth listening to?"" - it legitimates their goal of upsetting the order.

Typhron,"When you break it down, it's far more insidious. Since advertising itself isn't a corporate culture only thing...but corporate culture loves to use advertising.

Ads are one of the few ways to engage in a large swath of people without using language these people understand. Not only is it a way of getting into someone's mind, but stay there and permeate a thought space made exclusive for whatever the ad is for. That in itself is usually never bad until you enter Co-opting. In which case, the very idea of any hot button issue becomes boiled down to a way to get something across, which ends up being a moral problem and/or reduces that  issue to the butt of a joke. Or, in this case, turns the real and hot political division plaguing the USA into a way to remind people of a game involving an entirely different version of the country.

The examples I listed (which everyone fell for, again) should kept in mind regarding that. Dante's Inferno's advertising had a 'sin to win' contest inviting people to do whatever sinful acts they could think of to win some tat, AND this bait was revealed in a way that would get as much press and attention as possible. Likewise, the publisher behind such (EA, of course) didn't pull up on te reigns when it came to using other issues as footstools rather than platforms (LGBT rights, police brutality, etc).

All that sounds rather insane, right? Well, the worst of it is we don't really, and can't really, stop that if the campaign is successful since people fall into the mob mentality rather easily. We can prevent the damage from being largescale (and this is gaming, the scales don't get that large anyway), and this kind of crap doesn't really work over time...still.

[Like how a random guy on twitter accused Mike Rowe of being a nazi sympathizer simply because he didn't make a political comment about charlottesville.](http://mikerowe.com/2017/08/otw-the-overarching-logical-fallacies/)  Yet Mike Rowe also didn't make any comment defending or promoting Nazi's either.  He didn't make ANY comment.  Yet by being neutral, someone attacked him and claimed he was a nazi.  This is where things get dangerous.  You can argue we are losing free speech when people demand you have to make a statement about everything.  And then they label you as a nazi or racist if your view doesn't line up to theirs.  Even if your view doesn't support even mention nazi's in any way.

This mindset also leaks into media.  Various movies and video games have been putting political messages into games.  Because the last incarnation of the game got ripped on social media for not point out the social injustice of [x] historical figure.  So the next game, they start putting in a lot of political views about Karl Marx or Thomas Jefferson or whoever social media complained about last time.  But then those political messages anger others.  And you have a spiraling cycle where you anger one side by trying to appeal to the other.  All of which could have been avoided if they just didn't add politics into it in the first place.

But in the case of this game, you can't really avoid a political message.  So its pretty obvious they went all in and created a controversy to get a lot of free publicity.  And just look at the thousands of responses we're seeing today?  It worked.",2017-10-07 01:30:11,7,

Hamakua,"Not the person you replied to but I'd like to share a perspective and what I think is going on and where all the outrage is coming from.

Some of this is from memory so it's not perfect - but during the campaign Hillary tried to ""flip"" Trumps campaign slogan by implying ""Ameirca is already great"".  The general attempt fell flat and was largely forgotten.

This issue currently is the phrasing and what we can imply through political rehtoric.

Lets take the two messages ""Make America Great Again"" and ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" (the slogan in the game marketing).

Well if we take these two messages side by side - first and foremost - one is absolutely cribbed from the other - there is no disputing this.  And secondly, side by side, it adopts the same sort of ""stance"" as what Hillary's campaign attempted during 2016.  Imply making america great (again) was redundant.

If viewed from this framing it puts ""make America America again"" as the opposing stance against the message it's cribbing from - a ""correction"" much like what the Hillary Campaign tired.   If that's the case then the message ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" is challenging would place it by default on the ""other side"" - in this case ""The Nazi side"".

There is more to it than just the above but the above is a good general framing as to why it's disingenuous to write-off conservatives being upset about this as them de-facto trying to defend Nazis.   Conservative offense in this case, at least from what I can see - isn't being taken because people are attacking Nazis - it's because people are attacking conservatives being lumped in via campaign slogan cribbing *with* Nazis - when for over the last year they've been painted as Nazis 24/7 by their political opponents.

bobdobbsisdead,"What do you think Nazism was?

It was a bunch of lost white kids after a major recession who felt that their cultural identity was being threatened by immigrants. Nazism was specifically about restoring Germany to its former glory through racial nationalism, a return to ""traditional"" German values, and the rejection of ""invaders"" from other countries - such as the Jews and the gypsys. Hence notions like ""the blood and the soil"" (calling for a white European ethnostate), or Kulturbolschewismus (a rejection of aesthetic or academic creations that challenge traditional values). 

On a side note, the hatred of Jewish peoples was not original to Hitler or the Nazis, but historic in Germany. Hitler just mobilized it into a political tool.

Even ignoring that the REAL American Nazis - Richard Spencer and his crew over at Alternative Right, who are literally calling for a white ethnostate founded on ""traditional"" American values - it's pretty damn scary that we now have a campaign that ran on the tail end of a recession, focused on ""Making America Great Again"", ""traditional"" values, rejecting ""invaders"" from other countries. Meanwhile, their supporters are marching with literal ""blood and soil"" signs, calling for genocide (to ""glass"" Muslim nations), rejecting aesthetic or academic work that challenges traditional values, and even a twisted rebirth of ""bolshevik"" as a snarl word - this time as ""marxism"". 

There's not really a difference here, and it's terrifying that it's becoming mainstream.

PS. The hatred of Jews was actually pretty historic in Germany by the time that Hitler came around. Even the ""Jewish friendly"" leaders had an attitude of ""we won't kill you, but we will repress you!

Also: MAKE PRUSSIA GREAT AGAIN.

Edit: Actually there is one big difference. The Nazis were actually a well organized and successful political party by the time they came to power (granted, 30 odd years after Hitler became the head of it). There's nothing like that in America right now.",2017-10-07 00:52:04,1,

""That all citizens of Porto Rico, as defined by section seven of the Act of April twelfth, nineteen hundred, ""temporarily to provide revenues and a civil government for Porto Rico, and for other purposes,"" and all natives of Porto Rico who were temporarily absent from that island on April eleventh, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, and have since returned and are permanently residing in that island, and are not citizens of any foreign country, are hereby declared, and shall be deemed and held to be, citizens of the United States: *Provided*, That any person hereinbefore described may retain his present political status by making a declaration, under oath, of his decision to do so within six months of the taking effect of this Act before the district court in the district in which he resides, the declaration to be in form as follows...""

There is the original alt-right which named itself.  They actually are white supremacists, neo-nazi's ect.  It formed out of an alliance between the neo-Nazis, the white supremacists, the ethno-nationalists, and the various other subgroups of actual racists.  They are easy to spot because they'll flat out tell you what they are.  

Then there is the new wave of conservative voters Trump attracted.  The media kept calling them the alt-right to confuse people with the actual alt-right.  By naming the alt-right they can call Trump's supporters racist as much as they want without merit.

Trump base being what it is, saw the media wasn't stopping and took the term and ran with it.  Just like they did with deplorables.

So there are two alt-rights that share the same name, the Trump alt-right and the older Neo-Nazi alt-right.  Media intentionally branded the Trump supporters with the same name as actual racists as a political attack to confuse people like you.

But communism itself isn't about hatred of an ""other"" because of their race. The genocides of the USSR were political, not racial, in their nature. The deaths in China were from failed policies rather than malice.

MilitaryBees,"God.  Fucking this.  Grew up following the punk scene in a few small southern towns.  There was a group of skinheads that started showing up in one town.  Just like 3 of them at first.  They caused some shit, got into a fight, and ran out.   Then the same people showed up a town over.  This time they had recruited a couple more people.  Same thing happened.  Shit, fight, ejection.   Few weeks later they show up in another town.  Exact same dudes as before, this time now there is about a dozen of them and they were packing small weapons (brass knuckles, knives).  Now they're in too large a number to feasibly eject without getting people hurt.  They quit holding shows in that area shortly after because there would be a small ""rumble"" outside every night.   (I wasn't there for it but allegedly the final straw was them going after an interracial couple during the last show.)

I didn't hear much about them after that, but I'm sure they didn't stop at that city.  They're like fucking locust.   ",2017-10-06 22:00:22,92,

DoktorSoviet,">Personally I prefer open dialogue since I'm more into doing proactive things like eliminating racism and Nazism, 

Well good job, because you are one of the reasons it is spreading so much.

Nazism and its ilk (white nationalism/supremacy) don't deserve an open dialogue because this legitimizes them. For every person you might convert or dissuade through an open dialogue, there's ten more who see the Nazis as legitimate because you had to spend precious time and resources debating it as though it was an actual opinion.

This is a big problem with the American left: we think these battles can be won through information, fact, and reason. They can't, because these viewpoints are anathema to those principles to begin with and won't be persuaded by them. All debate does is elevate the opposing side. We made this mistake with climate change: rather than dismiss the deniers outright, we tried to debate them.

The reason this failed is because when people tend to see two sides of an issue debating, it gives the sense that both sides have some legitimacy and that either one is a valid choice. That's what we are conditioned too believe, with presidential ""debates"" where one candidate's opinions and feelings are just as valid as another candidate's facts.

I know it feels like the right thing to do but we learned the last time that open dialogue doesn't work on groups of people who don't desire it. There was no ""dialogue"" to be had with the Nazis back in '33, '36, or '39 because Hitler and the Nazis *weren't looking for diplomatic solutions*. Hitler himself admitted that if the KPD and the SPD had been able to recognize the Nazis for the threat that they were and suppress them (violently even), he would never have been able to seize power. These are people whose core ideology is based around achieving insane and violent principles, so trying to persuade them with facts and understanding will get nowhere because they don't want understanding and their opinions aren't based on fact.

You can reason with some racists, but I firmly believe anyone who is far-right enough to be full on Nazi or ""white nationalist"" (which is just a dolled-up term for Nazism, really) is beyond negotiating with. Some people are racist just because of bad experiences or being misguided, but it takes an actually malicious person to be a firm believe in the aforementioned ideologies.",2017-10-07 07:27:26,5,
,"The point of opening a dialogue isn't to let them soapbox and spread their hatred, it's to get to know them as human beings and find out why they think the way they do.

Believe it or not, racists *are* human beings, and there is *usually* a reason for their racism.  Whether they were taught by their parents or had a bad experience that pushed them in that direction or simply are falling back on habit and ignorance, almost every single racist has a reason for their racism.  And outside of that racism, they are just regular people who are trying to live their lives the best way they know how.

You don't change minds through shunning and shouting people down, you change them through information, education, and dialogue.",2017-10-07 16:25:47,3,
MysteriousDrD,"I had a quick browse through your post history, and within the first page or so found a post talking about 'cultural marxism' and another complaining about 'globalism' which are both pretty strong signifiers and dogwhistles used by white supremacist/nazi groups as standins for racist terms that would be deemed unacceptable to share otherwise, and assuming you're acting in a good faith here and not just trolling for a reaction (fuck it i'll take the risk, if you're trolling you got me), those terms are extremely loaded and to anyone who is aware and up to date on those terms, it seems like you're using the same speech as those groups. It's like how for a while you got white supremacists using terms like 'race realism' and the like before that became an obvious front for racist views.

Assuming you're being genuine here and you're just a conservative who has picked those terms up because a certain segment of political right associated with white supremacist groups uses that as their main tactic, taking otherwise innocuous sounding terms and using them to hide hate speech so that when someone on the left points it out they can retort with 'silly liberals, you can't say anything these days without being called a nazi!' So what ends up happening is people on the left who aren't aware of this tactic attack centrist or moderate conservatives who just use the terms not realising their associations b/c they saw it on twitter or reddit etc, and then those leftists end up looking like nutcases who are attacking you for apparently no reason. Another good example of this is when Richard Spencer and some other dinguses started putting frogs in their twitter names, and the whole pepe/kekistan thing being a banner of the alt-right. It gave people a symbol to rally under and one you can easily dismiss with 'oh lol it's just a meme/joke/whatever' when given any criticism or callouts.

That's why white supremacist rhetoric and the like can be so insidious, because it's very hard to tell if someone is genuinely wanting to engage with you in a discussion or if they want to fall back on tactics like the above to waste your time and exhaust you into inaction so that their views can become more widespread and mainstream, granting them more power as a result and turning centrists and conservatives over to their side.

Don't get me wrong.  I get where you're coming from.

I know I'm going to be attacked on this point, but just because the right and racist policies happen to be bedfellows, that doesn't mean that everyone on the right is racist, and accusing everyone on the right of being racist adds a weird fuel to their fire and they feel like they need to defend themselves, and when you get wrong why they believe what they do it actually just entrenches them in their beliefs and makes them think the left is stupid and doesn't get it.  

It's like saying everyone on the left is a SJW Tumblrina who wants to cut off their sons' dicks and raise them as girls.  Hell, just give /r/the_donald a peruse and see how they misrepresent the left.  It's not constructive when either side does it.  It's just divisive and it's bullshit.  

The phrase ""Make America Nazi Free Again,"" is an obvious play on ""Make America Great again,"" and will obviously associate Trump and his supporters with Nazis.  It's designed to.  That was obviously intentional.  

Trump supporters have also been having to fend off accusations of being Nazis, so they're a bit defensive about it.  This was obviously meant to play off of those insecurities.  

Trump supporters who are also white nationalists/supremacists are the Trump supporters that have most been in the spot light.  

So we have a situation where Bethesda made some troll bait by associating Nazis with Trump Slogans in a way that could be interpreted multiple ways, a subset of Trump supporters taking the bait because they're defensive because the current narrative is focusing on white supremacists, and people mad at trump supporters without empathy toward them who will latch onto anything that paints Trump and his supporters negatively (and racism is an easy one.)  So we have trolls, people who took the bait, and people who delight in believing that they're all racists because they don't fully understand them.  

It's just super obvious marketing.  It's manufactured controversy because all the pieces are so easy, and the disgusting part is that everyone seems to be falling for it.  Left and right.

1. He should direct his vengeance against those who actually did it back then - if they're all dead now, having died peacefully in their beds, then the hope for revenge is lost forever.

2. They were occupying the country - it was an act of war. They were also generally in power. They engaged in human rights abuses, and they were a centralized force.

Yellers on the street are currently in a democratic liberty nation - it's not even clear whether they advocate for killings, occupations and oppression until you actually hear them say that; and allowing violence against political opinions (*especially* those who're only indirectly associated with actual anti-liberty thought, rather than being such itself) can turn back around on you, and send the nation on a slippery slope down to chaos and/or tyranny.

I remember him trying to say that the ""real Nazis and racists belong to the Democratic Party"" and that no white supremacists switched to the G.O.P. That it was just a lie perpetuated by the media. 

I believe so yes. I should mention that I haven't actually read the book as I've never seen anything close enough to intellectual honesty from D'Souza to make me think it's worth my time to listen to him. 

>I should say, however, that advocating physical violence against those who espouse ideas that you don't like is fascist behavior itself. Point out the flaws in their reasoning, the hypocrisy, and the massive amounts of projection. It's more effective than making them martyrs.

Going to have to disagree with you here. Before I go any further let me be clear about something: I take the point that allowing the mob to determine who is and isn't deserving of a kick in the face can lead to all kinds of bad outcomes even if I'm skeptical that the problem of misidentification leading to violence is as common as some on this thread would lead us to believe. 

That said, if we're talking in a more abstract sense about whether it's ok to respond with physical violence to somebody who is a Nazi then I think that's 100% acceptable. To be clear I'm not saying somebody that you *think* is a Nazi, I'm not saying somebody that holds particular right-wing views that I find abhorrent, I'm saying an actual blood and soil Nazi. The reason I would argue that it is NOT fascistic is because Nazism, by it's very nature, demands the wholesale murder of so-called racial ""enemies"" and other undesirables generally. If you're say, a black person, and you run up against a Nazi I don't see any reason why that black person is *morally* in the wrong for reacting with violence. By virtue of that Nazi identifying with Nazism he or she is implicitly agreeing with the premise that the black person in our example is less than human and at best should look forward to a life of slavery and at worst should be murdered outright. If that's the case I see no compelling reason why the black person in our example should be expected to keep his or her cool in the face of somebody *who would gladly murder them if they could so without repercussions.*

The obvious retort here is that as long as it's still just speech then they haven't done anything yet. I don't actually find that to be a terribly convincing argument because if you're willfully advocating violence to an entire group of people based on their inherent characteristics then you may not engage in the violence yourself but you are supporting it and furthermore you are actively trying to bring it about through your advocacy. In that situation I see no moral distinction between a stormtrooper and Goebbels just because one isn't directly engaging in the violence themselves. The fact remains that the mouthpiece is still using the resources available to them to advocate for the dehumanization and murder of a broad swathe of people. Before somebody comes along and says ""Isn't that what you're doing right now?"" let me clarify. I'm not doing that because I'm not saying that anybody deserves to be harmed by virtue of immutable, uncontrollable characteristics about themselves, I'm saying that some ideas are so odious and harmful to society at large that confronting them with violence is acceptable recourse.

I want to take a moment to touch on this point:
>Point out the flaws in their reasoning, the hypocrisy, and the massive amounts of projection. It's more effective than making them martyrs.

I understand what you're saying and in a perfect world I would actually agree with you. I'm just very skeptical that people, on the whole, are rational enough to be persuaded by argument about things like Nazism. I think that by and large if you're a space where you're seriously considering Nazism as a political affiliation then you won't be dissuaded by argument because it's an ideology almost completely devoid of any intellectual content. Nazism is all pathos all the time because its core ideas are based on ideas of race that we've known are bullshit since the 1970s. Certainly there are some who can be dissuaded through argument and I don't want anybody to have the impression that I think violence against this sort of thing should be the FIRST response necessarily, only that it ought to be an acceptable response depending on the context. I think that way more people are persuaded by demagoguery and grandstanding than reasoned discussion and for that reason I think it's incredibly dangerous to be engaging with Nazism in anything resembling a forum that might give legitimacy to those ideas. Not because I think there's anything intellectually compelling about Nazism but because I think that the intellectual bankruptcy of Nazism is no defense against people glomming onto it for a whole host of other reasons more related to identity than thought. That being the case I think that if you make it clear that Nazism won't be tolerated by anybody for any length of time then you provide a deterrent to those who might find it attractive for the reasons I just mentioned. It's one thing to say ""I think that guy is saying a lot of things that other people aren't willing to say! Just like me!"" it's another for that same person to decide that identifying with those people is worth risking a punch in the face.",2017-10-07 17:55:33,2,

Do you honestly think that the government wouldn't be above stripping **your** rights when you sign in laws restricting the flow of information when someone who is fundamentally against your ideology is elected?

We are not in any age where the American people are being subjected to ridiculous inflation and a need to get out of destitution at any means necessary.

My grandparents had lived through Fascist Italy; if you want Fascism and the like to spread, attacking a fucking ideology in which the core tenet is **Direct Violent Action** does nothing but give them more chances to grow.

They did this with the Spartacists and other Communist and Socialist parties in the Weimar Republic and they will surely do this again. You attack their freedom of speech, they make appeals and protest that get people who believe in freedom of speech to fight for their rights. Nazis other similar ideologues are a hornet's nest; you poke it and you lose, and ultimately doing nothing is a loss in itself. To destroy the nest is to forgo any values of liberty and democracy you think you have.

We are not the Weimar Republic. Barbarism has no place in our politics; we either accept their freedom of speech or we sign our own away when groups like the Evangelicals (or any other group like this) starts claiming that those darn atheists said mean, hateful things about them that are no where near what the Nazis have said.  However, if they start violently protesting and rioting like some of their anarchist counterparts, I see no reason not to quash their riots by force.

And before you say ""we didn't win WWII by debating the Nazis"", that my friend is a false equivalence. We're talking a domestic problem, not a despotic regime declaring war on us. Unlike Climate Change, where there are some (debatable) statistics and scientists going against it (the infamous posts about the Roman and Minoan Warmings), most people don't think an ideology that wants to wipe out most of the human race including themselves if they're not ""Aryan"" enough is a sensible position. Most people don't think that living under a state similar to George Orwell's ""1984"" is anywhere near sensible. Most people don't believe in ideological tenets like direct violent action. This is how you [defeat](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/21/german-town-tricks-neo-nazis-into-fundraising-for-anti-extremist-org.html) them, not by basing your arguments on or opinion, emotion.

I'd point out that being trans is kind of something you deal with on a lifelong basis, they were trans but just not out (same way someone like Rock Hudson was always gay as shit, he just wasn't out yet).  I'd also note that more and more people are recognizing that there's definitely some level of trans subtext within the film, so it isn't really irrelevant to point out in a context like this.

If you're interested on the subtext:

The big scene that makes it pretty obvious is the final fight with Agent Smith in the subway: Smith drags him onto the tracks and talking about the sound of impending death before saying goodbye to Neo by calling him Mr Anderson.  The beat of this scene centers on Neo exclaiming ""My name is Neo!"" before narrowly escaping death, and seemingly finally accepting that he *is* The One.   The name element is pretty obvious(his survival hinges on that single moment of asserting his identity as Neo, an identity he had once kept hidden and parallel to his 'real'
 life); but it's also worth keeping in mind that as a teenager, due to dysphoria, Lana wrote a suicide note before going to an empty subway station and nearly throwing herself onto the track.

American politics has gotten very interesting in the last ten years.

The militia movement barely existed until the end of 2008. That's when the United States chose a president who several tens of millions of Americans firmly believed was a black communist Muslim, born in Kenya and elected to take away their guns, put them in FEMA-run concentration camps, and subvert the American government into a communist, fascist Muslim theocracy forever.

Let's ignore how several of those concepts are mutually exclusive, because regardless of reality or how political theory works, that's what millions of people in the United States were convinced of after 2008, thanks to a corporation founded with the intent of creating a profitable, self-sustaining domestic propaganda machine.

And those people vote.

If that was an accurate, 100% truthful description of your country's  leadership, and it was only a matter of time before those elected officials moved to take over the country and implement their agenda, what would be the ethical response?

How far should you go when the other side is gathering strength and planning to eliminate your democratic government and replace it with an unholy fusion of Nazi Germany, the 1950's Soviet Union, and 1979 Iran, while opening your borders to allow millions of Jihadists to set up their own ISIS-style local governments everywhere?",2017-10-07 16:32:16,2,

>I think theyâ€™re more of the immature reactionary alt right

I don't know what you're basing that off other than personal bias, but data shows otherwise. How many people on the ""alt-right"" do you know who self identify as liberals?

>â€œanti SJWâ€ segment

""SJW""s represent a growing and disturbing trend of people on the left who disavow or disregard foundational ideals of the traditional left like free speech and free expression. They're what I tend to call the ""authoritarian left"", and many classical liberals and leftists are opposed to them. Nearly all the popular ""anti SJW"" figures I can think of identify either as liberals or libertarians.

Ozcolllo,"I'm a big fan of the Socratic Method so let's start out with a question;  If you can explain, in a succinct manor, the basis of your reasoning and then work step by step to explain and logically arrive at why something isn't in the best interests for a free society, do you really believe that most people wouldn't be able to understand?  Especially if you can show them that it's in their self-interest to do so?  I believe that people can, especially if you can show how something could negatively or positively affect them.  If I had to guess, this would be the root of our disagreement.  If I'm right about that, how could you ever trust the judgement of a person to determine when violence should be used against someone who espouses an opinion that they disagree with?

You're naive if you believe the violence would ever stop once we go down that road.  When you have protesters who start assaulting those that they perceive as Nazis (I know that you had a hyper-specific example, but I'm trying to discuss real world applications.), you're going to create martyrs.  All of those disaffected whites that voted for Trump will respond in kind.  They already consume a wholly different media than we do, thanks to confirmation bias in the selection of media becoming socially acceptable.  Their media's outrage machine will go nuts and then you'll really have violence on your hands.

Intellectually honest debate isn't for the Nazis themselves.  The discussion and debate is for the viewers as you'll rarely convince an ideologue.  It's also not a ""perfect world"" scenario, it's a scenario that has taken into account just how effective conservative media is in creating boogeymen and uniting those who consume their media.  If you believe that violence is ever okay to stifle some ideal, then you've not spent the time required considering the outcome.

I sure as hell cannot trust the judgement of some of the protesters from the left either.  If you think that we aren't just as likely to get wrapped up in a confirmation bias fueled mob rage then that should give you pause.  

>The reason I would argue that it is NOT fascistic is because Nazism, by it's very nature, demands the wholesale murder of so-called racial ""enemies"" and other undesirables generally.

It doesn't necessarily necessitate genocide.  I've spent quite a lot of time trying to understand the groups that attended the Charlottesville protests and the ideals that they espouse.  It seems that the Nazis and the White Nationalists want an ethnostate or want to limit immigration as a way to keep whites as the majority.  Whether or not they've tried to dress up their idiotic views for better mainstream consumption is arguable.  Either way, I will not try to rationalize the use of their methods by those on my side, especially by such a subjective measure (morals).  History has shown us time and time again that it doesn't end well.

deadfenix,"So there are undoubtedly Trump voters with no desire to see any classes of people exterminated that also believe they are being incorrectly labeled as Nazis. Whether or not that's actually happening to them, they believe that there are people that consider them to be a Nazi regardless of how much they state they aren't.

Combine that with what you just said. To them, you just advocated for preemptive physical violence against Nazis. Based on how quick you were to label people Nazi apologists that should burn in hell and how afraid they are they that others will think they are a Nazi, they assume you would label them as such. They now fear you would use violence against them. They fear their safety is at risk because of your threat.

Now following your logic, if they attacked you first, it would be an acceptable action done in self-defense. This is just the tip of the iceberg of where this ""logic"" leads. I hesitate to call it logic because, although there are some local connections to be found, they are bound together by assumptions driven by fear. 

Fear that assumes the worst perspective of someone, their intent, and their predicted actions are reality. Fear that leads to people demonizing and dehumanizing others in the name of safety and self-defense.

The same kind of fear that pushed our politics to where it is now. The same kind of fear that our current president relied on to get votes. That he has continued to rely on since assuming office.

Deterrence is the best defense. Not offense. Not provocation. Make it apparent that attacking you is too risky and difficult. Be a hard target. Don't make them think you're an immediate threat. Instilling fear in others by threatening to act first backs them into a corner. That causes survival instinct to kick in, logic disappears, they attack first. To them, they have nothing left to lose since not acting first means death. At that point, all you can do is try to minimize the harm inflicted on you. Whereas deterrence means no attack is attempted and no harm is done. This is basically the foundation of any effective security policy.

I genuinely don't know how you can talk about unopposed leftist politics, every single even moderately left wing movement gets a shitload of resistance from everyone to centrists to the far right (and not to mention a lot of moderate liberals) so I very much disagree with you there. Like, a small example here is people disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn's planned policies to give school dinners to kids in the UK because he was on the left - not because of the plan nor the implications thereof, just because he is a leftist.

On your racism point, I disagree entirely and emphatically and points like ""if you open your eyes, everyone is racist"" are the EXACT THING that is getting people calling you a Nazi. I am the whitest of white people and my place in society is not being 'given up' nor am I being shamed into giving it up, I'm personally supporting and working for a world where EVERYONE has a place in society, fundamental human rights and equality are not a limited resource, even if you're a hardcore conservative. We can disagree on immigration, funding for social works, education, taxation etc across the board but that is a hard line for me.

Look dude, I'll leave it here and we can go about our lives but I will make an honest effort here to ask to you to consider the fact that you're tying yourself politically to some really bad people who don't even hold the views that matter to you, and these are people who don't hold the views you hold and are just co-opting them so that they can give themselves a base of power, at which point they can throw you away because they've got what they want. It's appealing because those groups are taking advantage of the fractured and disorganised left, and the moderates who aren't always aware of the political nuances of the current days to turn folks who have moderate and conservative views to their side by making you feel like you don't belong and society rejects you so that you'll turn to the one group that does.

> I am naming those because everyone knows these. You are correct in that they might not be related since the ""good"" nazis didn't want to subscribe to the nazi ideology.

There were no ""good Nazis"" in the Nazi ranks. The paramilitary corps of loyalists and officers was comprised of the Sturmabteilung (SA, most commonly referred to as 'brownshirts') and the Schutzstaffel (SS). The military was comprised of the Wehrmacht. If you were Wehermacht, you most likely volunteered out of a sense of patriotic defense of country or were conscripted depending on which half of the war we're discussing and most likely didn't have a good understanding of what was going on in the prison camps (though the Wehermacht committed their own war crimes against the Soviets).

The concentration camp and main atrocities that people associate with the Holocaust were carried out under the SS. Those that enlisted and served in the SS were the true believers. They were the scum upon which modern Neonazis base their ideals of paramilitarism and racism upon. There are no Neonazi organizations carrying around Wehrmacht flags, as they carry around adapted Neonazi symbols from SA and SS symbology such as the SS flag, the Hakenkreuz (Nazi swastika), the Totenkopf (Nazi skull), the Wolfsangel, and other adapted runic symbols associated with SS military divisions.

There were no ""good Nazis"" in the SA or SS. These people committed atrocity after atrocity and were completely aware of what they were doing.

Nazism was pro-private business, Communism was pro-public owned business. 

Nazism was anti-organized labor, Communism was pro-organized labor. 

Nazism was anti-class conflict, Communism was pro-class conflict.

Nazism was pro-conflict between nations, Communism was anti-conflict between nations (yes it is splitting hairs but ideologically they viewed wars as a class struggle not a national struggle).

Nazism was anti-women in politics, Communism was pro-women in politics.

Nazism had an extreme racial identity, Communism did not, workers were workers. 

Nazism wanted religion to work for them, Communism outright dismissed religion. 

Both were authoritarian. 

Nazism was anti-capitalism for various reason but mostly that it threatened, in various forms, the peoples relationship with the nation. Communism was anti-capitalism because it rewarded those who had the means of production at the expense of those who did not and therefore had to sell their labor.  

It is a little simplistic. Most people just look at the terms and say well ""national socialism is half a step away from communism"" where socialism in German had nothing to do with Marxism in any form. Marxism was an economic theory that sorta boiled down to everything was everyones property and you got out of something what you put in with a lot of limitations on other things (like democratic elections) in order for things to function. National Socialism was more along the lines of subordinating your personal interest for the good of the nation or community and all your work was intent on serving your nation.

I am not even going to touch about whether or not all the dictators mentioned were lefty or righty. I will add that the United States and Australia practiced genocide on the native populations of their respective continents, so.... Was all this actually how things were/worked?

you can crack down on drugs by patrol more to find them. if people resist arrest, the violence is indirectly stemming from the crack down, but the crack down isnt about getting violent, its about getting drugs.

Hamakua,"Not the person you replied to but I'd like to share a perspective and what I think is going on and where all the outrage is coming from.

Some of this is from memory so it's not perfect - but during the campaign Hillary tried to ""flip"" Trumps campaign slogan by implying ""Ameirca is already great"".  The general attempt fell flat and was largely forgotten.

This issue currently is the phrasing and what we can imply through political rehtoric.

Lets take the two messages ""Make America Great Again"" and ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" (the slogan in the game marketing).

Well if we take these two messages side by side - first and foremost - one is absolutely cribbed from the other - there is no disputing this.  And secondly, side by side, it adopts the same sort of ""stance"" as what Hillary's campaign attempted during 2016.  Imply making america great (again) was redundant.

If viewed from this framing it puts ""make America America again"" as the opposing stance against the message it's cribbing from - a ""correction"" much like what the Hillary Campaign tired.   If that's the case then the message ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" is challenging would place it by default on the ""other side"" - in this case ""The Nazi side"".

There is more to it than just the above but the above is a good general framing as to why it's disingenuous to write-off conservatives being upset about this as them de-facto trying to defend Nazis.   Conservative offense in this case, at least from what I can see - isn't being taken because people are attacking Nazis - it's because people are attacking conservatives being lumped in via campaign slogan cribbing *with* Nazis - when for over the last year they've been painted as Nazis 24/7 by their political opponents.

This is just one more Godwins law throwdown.  - And those seeking to ""pile on"" are being purposely obtuse about the complaints from Conservatives. ",2017-10-07 19:44:21,1,

I don't think it is. I don't expect to see literal Nazis making massive political gains, but other equally disgusting parts of the alt-right are still about white supremacy and fascism without the historical stigma of being literal Nazis.

>Taking a boot to their face is sure to fire them up, though

Dude, a fascist's default and only state is ""fired up"", there is no such thing as a peaceful fascist. The fact that they advocate for things like belligerent nationalism, genocide, racial supremacy, ethnic cleansing, etc. (pick a few of those depending on which facet of the alt-right you're talking about) means that they're violent and destructive by default.

This is like blaming the US Civil Rights movement for ""firing up"" the KKK. They were already fired up, the Civil Rights movement just put them on the defensive: because it was an effective threat to them.

>Thanks ANTIFA. 

Do you know antifa's history? The movement started in Germany in 1932 as a counter to fascists because *nobody else was trying to stop them*. The Nazis were already dangerous, they did just fine making up an ""enemy"" in Jews, communists, etc.

>Their whole narrative is that they're a subjugated people, and if we go around punching them out when they go out in public, doesn't that make it a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy?

Their whole schtick is that they only really exist in political environments where their scapegoating (against Jews, black people, leftists, Muslims, Mexicans, whatever works) is already more attractive than reality. That's why Trump winning was a big deal to the alt-right: not because he's a fascist, but because he showed just how effective blaming everything on minorities is right now.

If they're around, it's because they've already effectively created their own fake ""enemy"" and it's working. Having an actual opposition doesn't change anything, except for the better.

Allar666,"> I believe that people can, especially if you can show how something could negatively or positively affect them. If I had to guess, this would be the root of our disagreement. If I'm right about that, how could you ever trust the judgement of a person to determine when violence should be used against someone who espouses an opinion that they disagree with?

To be clear, I absolutely believe that they CAN. What I'm skeptical about is the degree to which that process occurs en masse. I think things like socioeconomic status and cultural identity play a much, much bigger role in the political positions people take than rational discourse does. 

I actually think you have a valid point about how that makes it difficult to trust people to correctly identify who should properly be considered a Nazi and thus a fair target for violence. I was intentionally avoiding getting into specifics because my chief contention was with the idea that violence against Nazis is in some way morally equivalent to Nazi violence against others which I just think is categorically false because intentions and motivation for violence absolutely matter. That's what makes murder different from self-defense. I think the question of whether it's practical to engage in that sort of violence against actual Nazis in the context of the modern US is a more difficult and fraught question. Furthermore I don't actually know where I come down on that particular question, hence my insistence on talking in the abstract. 

Another point of difference that we have I think is you mention that if Nazis are responded to with violence the conservative mediasphere will lose it's ever-loving mind, create martyrs out of those who have been attacked and encourage their viewers to violence. I think that they're already doing that and I think they've been doing that for quite some time before Trump. The kind of shit spewing out of the conservative media during the Obama years was often implicitly or explicitly racist, violent and reactionary. I don't think they're going to stop and I find it difficult to believe that violence on the part of the left is going to make their already absurd hyperbole any worse. 
>It doesn't necessarily necessitate genocide. I've spent quite a lot of time trying to understand the groups that attended the Charlottesville protests and the ideals that they espouse. It seems that the Nazis and the White Nationalists want an ethnostate or want to limit immigration as a way to keep whites as the majority. Whether or not they've tried to dress up their idiotic views for better mainstream consumption is arguable.

You mention that it's arguable and that would certainly be my contention. I think there's all kinds of good reasons to think that they're just lying about this particular point. Even if they're not they certainly advocate making non-whites second class citizens at absolute best. I realize you said this was arguable I just want to make it clear that I trust the word of avowed white nationalists as far as I can throw them and don't actually care how they dress up their bigotry. 

> Either way, I will not try to rationalize the use of their methods by those on my side, especially by such a subjective measure (morals). History has shown us time and time again that it doesn't end well.

I get what you're saying here but that's sort of a meaningless statement isn't it? Of course morality changes and some of what was broadly acceptable 50 years ago isn't necessarily acceptable now and vice versa. That doesn't really matter though. We're wrong about things all the time, we still do the best we can with the knowledge and frameworks we have. Taking a stance about whether or not to use violence on Nazis is itself a moral position. Incidentally, history also teaches us the consequences of not confronting anti-democratic forces before they are able to seize control in a democratic system using the privileges extended to them by democracy to undermine that system.

>I really don't mean to sound combative throughout this post. I wish text was more efficient at displaying tone or I were more suited to word this in a more effective way. Sorry if this comes off as assholish.

Freedom of speech has nothing to do with Nazi socialism. But because you support a thing that also supports a nazis views... then that makes you a nazi too. Or a ""Nazi sympathizer"" or ""That sounds like something a nazi would say"" or whatever.

ProfessorLexis,"I think we've confused the tone a bit. I am not saying to make Devils Arguments *for* a racist claim, but how to respond to someone attempting one. And that not all attempts to use a DA are going to be for something as clearly black and white as an argument for racism. Bad ideas stand out on their own, no matter who is arguing for them. Genocide, for example, is wrong. Not because Hitler, a bad person, advocated for it but because it's inherently an evil thing. 

That said; I agree completely with not feeding Trolls. They ""win"" when you choose to feed them. However, not all expressions of negative views are based in the goal of being hateful. I believe there is a divide between being hateful and simply being ignorant. For example.

I live in a city that's pretty diverse. In the past I have had family visit from another state, where their hometown is almost entirely white. They have never interacted with a black person before and were very prejudiced against them, expressing a lot of racist stereotypes. It wasn't that they harbored any hate for them, they simply bought into what they had seen on TV. 

Japan, for another example, is generally pretty damn racist. Mostly towards other Asian nations, but they depict black people in a very negative stereotypical way. I have seen a lot of people say ""Well, fuck em. How dare they"". But the Japanese aren't hatefully racist towards black people, just ignorant of them. Their demographic is 98% Japanese. The vast majority will live their entire lives and never see someone of another race. 

In both cases, a little knowledge can change and better a person. Ignorance is easier to cure than hatred, its just hard to tell them apart. People *should* seek to correct their ignorance on their own, but sadly, people rarely go out of their way to counter a learned bias. 

For your last point on supporting playing Devils Advocate; I think you could call my argument here a DA. I attempted to explain and reason why Japan is so clearly racist. Not as a troll and not as a cover for some other bigotry. Just as a counter to the idea that ""The Japanese are a bunch of shitty racists"". A good DA is asking someone to dig a little deeper in a situation where the surface belief may not be the whole story. A bad DA is asking people to dig up something that's already pretty obvious.

I've also seen tons of people on the left throwing around the Nazi epithet seemingly without regard for who the target is as long as they're conservative.  Ben Shapiro, for example, is constantly labeled as a white supremacist and a Nazi.  He's an Orthodox Jew.  He literally wears a yarmulke and constantly gets attacked by the alt-right (aka actual Nazis) despite his status as a conservative.  Jordan Peterson and Bret Weinstein (another Jew...and as far as I can tell, also a liberal) are two others who make for frequent targets who really don't deserve to be called Nazis at all.

Saying ""Trump didn't say this, he actually said this!"" without providing the full quotes doesn't inspire much confidence in what you or the other person are saying. 

I could very well say Trump is a well documented liar, someone who frequently spouts in-eloquent statements that lack nuance or intelligence. That he runs his mouth and says the most ridiculous stuff. But this wouldn't mean a damn without contextual quotes, even if you can find countless examples of this in almost every interview he's done.

I guess here's my opinion: The younger whites that voted for Trump feel exactly the way you describe.  They are thinking about the pre 9/11 world they grew up in, and remember it fondly.  It wasn't so great for adults at the time though.  The 90s were ok, but it really was the calm before the social storms that brought us gay marriage and a more focused effort directed at issues like climate change, women's pay, and police reform.  More to the point, I think it is a huge mistake for younger Trump voters to believe that older Trump voters voted for him for the same reasons they did.  There is a huge, huge gap in priorities between the two.  The older group meant something very different by ""great again.""",2017-10-08 22:39:30,0,

However, it was not exactly a ""turning point"" - Hitler's conquest was doomed to failure from the moment he stepped into Russia.

For all his regime's advanced technology, Hitler was never close to winning the war. It is, however, entertaining to think of what the world might look like if he had the power to win - and that's why I play Wolfenstein.",2017-10-08 04:37:25,1,

ROGER_CHOCS,"I would imagine it depends on what you are going for. If your going for splatter reduction you might want a funnel with a small tip placed under the cheerios along the bottom of the bowl. It would be like filling from the bottom.  

For max splatter, you may want to try and free piss into the bowl prior to filling it with cheerios. You can stand on the table or climb a tree if outside in order to really get maximum effect from the gravity, and as a bonus afterwards you can pour the cheerios in and create more splatter.  

You could try and place your bowl of cheerios at the bottom of a slide, and piss onto the top of the slide and drain into the bowl. This seems inefficient though.. 

You could piss into a pot of spaghetti and cook it, then drain the piss into the cheerios bowl and serve the pasta to your rival Todd from accounting. Damned Todd.  

What about pissing upside down? That could be a fun but highly risky endeavor for obvious reasons.  

If you really wanted to impress a lady or friends, piss into the wind and have it land in the bowl of cheerios. Don't forget the sugar, ladies love sweets!  

You could star in a golden shower porno and strategically place bowls of cheerios around. Inefficient? Yes, but sexy if piss is your thing. 

Attach a vacuum to the end of your member and place a bowl of cheerios in the bag. Some of those dysons make it very easy to change the bag so I would guess the gained efficiency would allow this strategy to scale into things like homeless shelters and schools. Piss Cheerios for everyone! This very well could be the most efficient way to cover cheerios in piss. 

Don't flush a low flow toilet for a while and you will have a reserve of piss ready to go for your cheerios.  High flow toilets can yield a greater volume but this really only works if you have somewhere else to shit. At least that is what my friend told me.  

And last, purchase one of those Asian restaurants that have the sushi on a belt, and replace the sushi with cheerios, then just have your employees get bloody drunk and once they break the seal you can flip on the conveyor belt and get a good piss-on-cheerio/hour going.

And while its really not a big deal right now, this heavily loose use of the term nazi on people who aren't really nazis is only going to legitimize real neo-nazis, and even make people who wouldn't usually sympathize with nazis do so.

For people who don't really care about what they do for a living (non-passionate), they could learn and perform these roles. College doesn't need to be a 4-year party for people who don't care about their careers and will end up doing unskilled labor. Many cases can be different, but in general, I think that can hold true.

I prefer private retirement options because frankly, there are so many options as long as you actually understand money and investing. 401k, IRA, stocks, bonds, certificates, eREIT, Mutual Funds, ETFs, Forex, etc. I couldn't say how well off social security will be when the time comes but my personal investments together are doing quite well.

I'm not going to say that everyone is lazy, but I've definitely known some people to coast as long as they can.

It's an open conspiracy to commit mass murder, and should be treated as such by society and the law. 

Somehow we got it in our heads as a country that Nazis are harmlessly exercising their right to free speech, with no further motive. Guess what happened last time they were allowed to do that: the end of the Weimar Republic, the beginning of the Third Reich, and eventually the Holocaust. It seems that with so much emphasis placed on ""STEM"" subjects, we've forgotten the importance of history. We can't learn from our ancestors' mistakes if we don't keep the memory alive.

The collective memory isn't as raw for the younger generation as it was for us and our parents. The grandparents of kids being born now either were born much later than WWII or were too young to remember it. There's no more Eli Wiesels out there to explain the horror of what they lived through in intimate terms. No more grandfathers telling their grandchildren about D-Day or the Battle of Britain.

Each year there are fewer and fewer WWII vets/holocaust survivors alive and lucid enough to tell their stories. Soon there will be none, and history classes and museums will be the only thing reminding us of the Holocaust. If we want the true meaning of the word ""Nazi"" to stay intact, our first step should be to immortalize the history surrounding that word. 

Future generations need to see the videos of mass graves and the skeletal figures of the victims. They need teachers who aren't afraid to tell the whole story. Institutions like the US Holocaust Memorial Museum need to be expanded and protected.",2017-10-07 02:48:32,1,

__Hello_my_name_is__,"You see, I genuinely do not understand that argument. I'm not trying to make a point here, I really don't get it.

I mean, if I were accused of being a nazi because I support some political candidate, then my first instinct to ""fuck nazis"" wouldn't be: ""Well they're just trying to stir up drama now, since some people called me a nazi and therefore they're saying fuck me"". It would be: ""Yeah, fuck nazis. Also, neither me nor the candidate I support are nazis you idiots"".

I would do everything I can to make sure I don't get grouped with actual nazis. Which very much includes saying ""fuck nazis"" at every opportunity. I mean, even if I might support Sanders, I'm still happily saying ""fuck communism"", and will do so to everyone who accuses me of being a communist. Takes the wind right out of their sails.

If I were to argue that saying ""fuck communism"" is just an attempt to smear the non-communist Sanders fans, and that people therefore shouldn't buy into people saying ""fuck communism"", and that saying ""fuck communism"" is divisive now.. wouldn't that sound kinda stupid?

Some of this is from memory so it's not perfect - but during the campaign Hillary tried to ""flip"" Trumps campaign slogan by implying ""Ameirca is already great"".  The general attempt fell flat and was largely forgotten.

This issue currently is the phrasing and what we can imply through political rehtoric.

Lets take the two messages ""Make America Great Again"" and ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" (the slogan in the game marketing).

Well if we take these two messages side by side - first and foremost - one is absolutely cribbed from the other - there is no disputing this.  And secondly, side by side, it adopts the same sort of ""stance"" as what Hillary's campaign attempted during 2016.  Imply making america great (again) was redundant.

If viewed from this framing it puts ""make America America again"" as the opposing stance against the message it's cribbing from - a ""correction"" much like what the Hillary Campaign tired.   If that's the case then the message ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" is challenging would place it by default on the ""other side"" - in this case ""The Nazi side"".

There is more to it than just the above but the above is a good general framing as to why it's disingenuous to write-off conservatives being upset about this as them de-facto trying to defend Nazis.   Conservative offense in this case, at least from what I can see - isn't being taken because people are attacking Nazis - it's because people are attacking conservatives being lumped in via campaign slogan cribbing *with* Nazis - when for over the last year they've been painted as Nazis 24/7 by their political opponents.

This is just one more Godwins law throwdown.  - And those seeking to ""pile on"" are being purposely obtuse about the complaints from Conservatives. ",2017-10-07 19:42:18,0,

For whatever reason, if I don't 100% condone violence towards people you consider to be ""Nazis"", that somehow means I'm defending *actual Nazis*.

Just because it doesn't affect you now doesn't mean it won't affect you later on.

Let me get your perspective on this then since you seem to be a smart guy: if I wanted to defend free speech, how would I do it without being accused of being anything related to Nazis? How would I do it without wishing injury or death to someone, like wanting ""Nazi scalps"" or ""bash the fash"" or whatever the slogan is today? Supporting free speech means allowing everyone to speak freely, including allowing genuine Nazi scumbags to speak freely about their ideology.

The problem is that the people who are calling you a nazi truly do not care. I wish it were a case of mistaken identity. Maybe they have it mixed up where I want border security, govt out of healthcare and schools as much as possible, trade deals that benefit America, and a budget that provides for a well-equipped military - that it means I want genocide of all non-aryans and to dissolve the our democratic republic and replace it with a dictatorship and we can all wear matching outfits. That escalated quickly!

Its like you literally ignored the rest of my post, people are mad that Bethesda used the trend/meme of calling conservatives nazis, thats what they're mad about. And there are potential consequences with this which I also talked about in my quote.


I'm not mad, I don't who anyone calls a nazi. But in the year of 2017 the us vs. them mentality of far right vs. far left has been causing a divide in the united states. It was already getting pretty stupid back in 2016 with tons of protests and rallys and stuff, but literally the far-left far-right push has been getting stronger. As time has been going on more and more media coverage and more political violence has been occurring. Like if people don't chill the fuck out soon it very well could end up being neonazis vs. neocommunists in a few years. This political BS drama has literally caused people to hurt each other in the timespan of less than a year of its existance and if it manages to continue to progress it very may well tear this nation apart.


Now the odds of that at this time are still pretty low, but the amount of strong emotional reactions to petty drama are still very high, and bethesda stirring the pot just to make money is pretty shitty of them. Like anyone who stirs the pot deserves outrage, because this shit is really a non issue when it comes to the every day lives of normal americans, but when the media and other people related to the media make it the focus of american politics, nothing really good or useful is going to come of it regardless if it ends in a commie vs nazi war or not.

If you do that by disrupting an anti-nazi protest I'd argue you've picked the wrong time to march and you've picked a weird hill to die on.  Also saying that guy was defending nazis is in no way inaccurate, his argument was to let them have a platform to tell their side.

>For whatever reason, if I don't 100% condone violence towards people you consider to be ""Nazis""

Drop this ""People I consider to be nazis"" bullshit.  I've told you what nazis are, do you disagree with that?  You're going to tell me that people publicly identifying as nazis, marching alongside nazis with a swastika banner and an armband, shouting about eliminating jews aren't nazis?  Consider this, it's not whether someone thinks the wrong thing or not, it's about the shit they say and do in public.

>if I wanted to defend free speech, how would I do it without being accused of being anything related to Nazis?

ACLU defended the nazi's right to protest.  Donate to the ACLU.  I think the oathkeepers show up to protests with nazis and antifa.  You could protest along with them, although they strike me as a largely racist group but I did hear reports of them defending antifa from proud boy types.  

But here's the thing with these people who go and protest antifa.  They're not protesting for free speech.  If that were the case they'd shot up to BLM protests and defend them from cops--they don't.  Tim Pool doesn't have videos of cops tear gassing free speech protesters standing up for BLM.  All of these people only show up when it's nazis and it's because they realize they're really close to potentially being called a nazi or getting beat up at these events because their views or abhorrent and unpalatable to the public.  

I'm extremely pro free speech myself, I'm sure it doesn't sound like it from this argument we've been having.  The issue for me is that it is an act of violence to publicly attempt to instigate an ethnic cleansing.  It falls just short of the actual crime of conspiracy to commit mass murder, but only because the people doing it are clearly not powerful enough to accomplish their publicly stated plan.

The reason Nazis demonstrate is to provide a safe space for Nazis who haven't expressed their ideology in any form due to fear of stigma or retaliation or whatever. Not for any specific cause .

The reason Nazis debate is to spread their rhetoric to people receptacle to hate and Supremacy, and to sway people already toeing the line . They will spread rhetoric rather than actually argue points .

zasabi7,"Strictly speaking about the US, free speech is the greatest freedom our country enjoys.  Which is why it took me a long time to come to my conclusion: hate speech should be exempted from it's protection.  Here I define hate speech as public incitement against an identifiable group (race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.).

The key word here is public. It's impossible to stop someone from having a privately held belief and sharing it in confidence privately, but it is possible to silence the spreading of that belief through public channels.  By public channel, I mean anything that can identify the individual, so a speaking stage, an email chain, a web post (hardest to verify, but it's doable), a video, etc.

But why stop hate speech? It's been shown to cause actual harm (Words That Wound: Critical Race Theory, Assaultive Speech, and the First AmendmentÂ (Westview Press 1993)).  From my own experience, I can tell you my friends of color deal with some demons that I'll never have to.  My goal is that their progeny won't have the same issues and worries as them.

When I see groups like the KKK or the nut jobs waving Nazi flags in Charlottesville, it makes my blood boil.  Their speech represents an actual threat to my friends. I seek to silence that, and there are only two ways to do so: litigation or violence (you can argue that engaging them and converting them like members of the Black community have is also effective, but it's slow and it's not high yield. More over, it's hard to engage in this kind of dialogue when they have ideological echo chambers to reinforce them).

Despite my initial post, I don't want death or violence.  I don't trust anyone, myself included, to carry out such a task.  Thus I seek legal ways to destroy such bigotry.  Such speech has no value for me.  I cannot think of a scenario where hate speech can be shown in a positive light.  (This is important to me, because I wouldn't want Art to suffer.  Racists and bigots can still be shown in negative light or even in positive if they contributed something to society and that is what is being highlighted (Hitler being one of the best orators of all time as an example).  But if the point of a work is to suppress others, than I don't think it has value.)

So those are my thoughts. It's taken several years to arrive at this conclusion, and I'm sure I missed some of the building blocks I used to get here, but I hope it makes sense. More over, I hope it's rational.  Thanks for reading.",2017-10-07 20:00:58,2,

But ok, you got me, apologies for assuming we were both talking about the United States, its first amendment, and the ideal of free speech as its understood in the US. That said;

I am doing what exactly? I never made *any* claims about the people making the nazi accusations. I didnt say they were criminal and I didnt say they should be silenced either. I said it was easy for them to do it and that it can severely impact the lives of those they do it to. 

However, their actions could be criminal. In the US the first amendment doesn't allow you to commit libel or slander. Harassment IS a crime. And enacting violence against someone is generally a crime too. So, if you brand someone a Nazi and then commit a crime against them because of that... then yes, that's against the law and not permissible.

Specifically you said ""I don't think they should be doing it."" You would like to see the antinazi crowd silenced, when they're properly using the same amendment the Nazis cling to so desperately. I don't see how you can be FOR Nazi right to expression while being hesitant to endorse their opposition. The arguments are the same, the only difference is the content.

Hamakua,"I'm not sure what you are trying to convey - I'm lost on ""the opponent"" thing.  Honestly I think Bethesda doesn't care or doesn't wish to dip its toes in this.  The *marketing* however is definitely playing on the political divisiveness of the current culture.  - beyond this point is more just my opinion.

The sense I'm getting from all of this is as follows

1.  Someone in a marketing department that Bethesda hired is left leaning and political
2.  Hating conservatives is in right now among ""Silicon valley"" and ""Left coast"" culture. - it's always in, but it's at a fever pitch right now.
3.  Some marketing figurehead thought ""lets poke the hornets nest for clicks and eyeballs"" - that it attacks their political opponents is just a bonus.
4.  The media, who is largely against the Trump's Presidency also is all for poking the hornets nest (this is for slightly different reasons).

So not only do you have a major corporation functionally using their platform to ""not so subtly"" attack a political side in American politics - but it does so rather unfairly.   [News media then also unfairly misrepresent the issue.](http://www.newsweek.com/nazi-video-game-wolfenstein-angers-nazis-make-america-nazi-free-again-slogan-679530)

I'm personally left leaning and even I got annoyed at the characterizations being made (the new far-cry tried to do something similar, but it was much more subtle).  Someone in the Bethesda chain of command gave the nod to poke the conservative hornets nest - functionally blanket calling them Nazis - then when they got upset about it the response was a ""Why are you upset about Nazi's getting killed?"" 

>Hurr durr, if you are offended by being called a Nazi - it must mean you are a Nazi

GGBVanix,"Look dude, calling for violence towards people preaching ethnic cleansing is just adding fuel to the fire. Trying to justify ""punching Nazis"" or whatever is going to motivate people to do just that, and innocent people are getting caught up in it.

Here's how to beat the actual Nazis the right way: just let them speak. Seriously. Let them say whatever hateful rhetoric they want in peace. You know what's going to happen? People will be disgusted by what they say because their ideology is terrible. They won't support them, they won't take them seriously, and the Nazis will slowly go back into hiding; not with a bang, but with a whimper. It worked for decades and it kept them down.

Remember the Westboro Baptist Church? In a nutshell, they were preaching a lot of hate and death toward groups they didn't like. But did anyone rise up against them? No. The worse that happened to them was people swearing at them and flipping them off. No one supported them. What do you think would happen if they were physically attacked? Lawsuits, criminal charges against the attackers, news coverage, and the support from those who support free expression with more opportunities to spin their message in a positive light.

This is exactly what's happening with ""Nazis"" when you call for violence against them; you're just pushing more and more rational people to side with them. That includes people of all races. [Charles Barkley is now a black ""white supremist"".](http://www.theroot.com/charles-barkley-is-a-great-example-of-a-black-white-su-1798149722) That sounds ridiculous, isn't it? That's because it is.

Identity politics are what started this whole thing to begin with. Rather than promoting equality, feminists claim to be oppressed and demand special treatment. Black people claim to be oppressed and demand special treatment. Mexicans claim to be oppressed and demand special treatment. Sooner or later, it's only natural for white people (particularly Nazis) to do the same thing. But nope, Nazi ideology called for genocide, therefore everyone needs to physically attack them for their speech, right? No, all you're really doing is legitimizing their grievances and emboldening them to push back harder. The ""punch a Nazi"" people punch harder, Nazis punch back harder, and continues to escalate from there with more and more people getting caught in the fray who are only given the choice between one side or the other.

The real solution to stop Nazis is to stop the violence, and to de-escalate the violence at this point, you need to condemn the violence from all sides, stop glorifying and praising violence towards anyone regardless of their affiliation, and highlight who's actually getting hurt in the conflict. Unfortunately, doing that means you're ""defending Nazis"". Suffice to say, I like my way of stopping Nazis better than yours.",2017-10-09 05:34:46,1,

Fascist violence comes when they're entrenched in power enough that they can't really be stopped. Not getting to that point is the important bit.

See, Wolfenstein is about the Nazis conquering America, and then having a resistance fighting against it. The Nazis in the game have power and are a maiority. Not only that, they're doing terrible things against other people that are being considered normal. It's obvious that you're going to have to kill them, since they'll try to kill you for stopping them. Just punch them, ffs.

In our timeline, however, the things are different. Nazis don't have power (last time I checked), they weren't a maiority, and they definitely do get backlash for doing shit. This means that it's fucking predictable that they're not going to do what they do in public to evite backlash. Like, if you see a nazi punching/killing someone for that person just being black, having diferent opinions or whatever, go for the fucking punch. But if you see the nazi just spewing his hate and expressing his opinions (how dumb they may sound), keep it cool, for fuck's sake.

jo-ha-kyu,">The idea that the capitalist adds no value to the worker's product and they are essentially parasites on the working class.

This is mostly true; the value is usually added by the people who *don't* extract surplus value, including middle-managers, accountants, engineers, and right down to the manual machinist. The capitalist and his board of members and stockholders don't really add much value at all. And if they do, then it's *still* no reason to be extracting the value of those who do more work in perpetuity.

>Which basically amounts to politicized jealousy

The idea that those at the bottom rungs of society, or those who are systematically exploited, are simply jealous of the wealth of those with wealth is a laughable idea. The problem is not merely the existence of wealth inequality, but rather the conditions which force it to exist and the fact that wealth inequality *widens*, which means that people with more are getting richer, or people with less are getting poorer. But with greater profits comes greater exploitation; the quality of life for those people decreases even though their wages stay the same. Either way, Communism isn't about reducing wealth inequality, it's about abolishing wealth in private property all together. 

>How is capital an oppressive force?

Capital is what creates the compulsion for the worker to either work for a wage or to starve, and it creates the class hierarchies which are necessary to maintain capitalism. It creates a strange compulsion for the owner of capital to devote all of his time and care to this single aspect of his ego - greed - in case he loses any. Finally, it has effects on our psychological well-being through the process of alienation and production for exchange. It poses a restrictive, hollow freedom, ironically which our freedom from this freedom (i.e the freedom from the freedom to work or starve) can be achieved only by eliminating that which sustains capital - wage labour.

Also, most Communists aren't in favour of cooperative organisations as ""Communism"". Communism is not merely ""workers owning a workplace"", it's the removal of exchange and wages by making them unnecessary. Coops have their own problems, and not everyone can work in a coop, or there would be no way to develop further.",2017-10-13 20:54:11,1,

Jealousy can be valid, being jealous is not inherently bad, but engaging in and gaining political power on the back of the idea that it's bad that Person A has more money than Person B, because...reasons is manipulative and doing the very thing I was talking about originally regarding how communism inherently makes wealthy people part of the society the ""other"" while at least nazism seeks to ""other"" an ethnic/religious minority. 
And I don't see how the lower classes are exploited, I've looked at communist ideas on this and I find them incredibly wanting and basically suffering the same problems of emotive language and thinking over analytical thinking. 
And objectively people are not getting poorer, there may be increasing wealth disparity but that doesn't mean there's then less wealth, again.
To me the idea of abolishing private wealth is insanely tyrannical and completely misunderstands both human nature and the role of property in human society.
Again, what if people like me don't want to submit? What about the Socialist Calculation Problem?



Regarding capital
How would capital force workers into a work or starve situation? I mean there were humans before humans had the need for capital, meaning they couldn't have survived if what you say is true, meaning we couldn't be having this conversation. 
No, every living thing must consume to sustain itself. Capitalism or capital doesn't dictate that, the nature of our existence dictates that. Prior to capitalism, the food didn't plant and harvest itself, no people always had to work to survive. ",2017-10-13 21:30:21,3,

throwawaycuzmeh,"First: I think we can safely define context, in substantial part, as a combination of time and place.

I conceive of the internet/cultural meme as largely a construction of ""now"". Internet/culture memes are also, generally, transient and temporary things. They tend to be tied to a specific item or event. This makes it difficult to claim distance or independence from those items or events when you evoke the meme in a supposedly unrelated context - especially when the context of origin rages all around you. 

By contrast, tropes are, almost necessarily, a product of history; something functions well over time and becomes a routine and predictable ""standard"". Tropes are archetypical, applicable in many times and places. There's a degree of highly plausible deniability there with respect to meaning and interpretation, mostly because tropes tend to be so old and well-worn that it would be impossible to isolate their context.

Even then, some tropes can become temporarily inappropriate based on current events. The trope of the wronged man out for bloody vengeance is potentially justifiably upsetting when you're society has just suffered a massive violent event, which is why Netflix is delaying the punisher until people are less traumatized by the Vegas shooting. 

Anita attacks tropes that are either deeply embedded within our collective history/biology *or* that are not even particularly legitimate as tropes. Her answer to the Vegas shooting would be to never release the punisher at all. In fact, no one should be making such things in the first place. 

In summation: I guess you could say I respect a certain amount of deference to current events and especially combustible situations when it comes to caricaturing people, places, and things. I reject anything resembling a permanent or absolute ban on such expressions, though.

I very much respect that and agree. I definitely see the reason to respectfully distance one self to events where recent tragedy happened.

I think our only point of difference is that in my opinion the ""MAGA"" meme is distant enough to justify its use without me morally objecting to the use. Like I said earlier I believe  that ""MAGA"" moved beyond its political roots and into international meme territory. Thus I dont really believe one should judge it in the context of its political origin.

mamercus-sargeras,"In marketing/sales there is an acronym called AIDA: attention - interest - decision - action. More attention doesn't necessarily translate into more sales. 

I actually do work in marketing and sales and being told to sell stuff no matter what often creates more problems than it solves: bad reviews, bad reputation, returns, chargebacks, cancellations, and even lawsuits. Trying to make a bad deal work usually leads to disaster unless you're a criminal and are good at avoiding the consequences. 

I think the Wolf 2 marketing probably alienated a lot of people, especially because shooter fans are probably more right wing than, say, fans of 'Gone Home.' Game journalists are pretty much irrelevant to marketing most games. They are much less trusted than, say, car magazine reviewers, and surveys routinely back this up. The only time when politically tinged marketing is really safe to use is when it's actually relevant to the product. Some material about gun rights or self-defense is relevant if you are selling guns or gun accessories, for example. If you're soliciting political donations, your copy oughta be political. 

Otherwise, most Americans are politically unaffiliated and even the ones who are politically affiliated don't have strong beliefs about most things. The people who are both politically affiliated and have strong beliefs are a tiny but vocal and influential minority. 

For Wolf 2 in particular, I generally don't buy new games anyway so all pre-release marketing is just there to sucker in idiots who preorder things sight unseen. Wolf 1 needs a bunch of screwy modfiication to even run without failing to cache textures and other crap like that on PC even now, so Wolf 2 definitely gets a 'wait 3 years for it to be on sale for $5' regardless if BJ Blaskowitz gets a sex change halfway through the game or not.

If you want.  If people understand that marketing can be shady and opportunist, they're not going to have much sympathy when marketers reveal they didn't believe what they were saying but felt like they needed to sell the product no matter what. 

It's entertainment. It's what people do with the free time and money they have to enjoy themselves. Even if their motivations are completely unreasonable, they've gone through the steps to make sure they can act on their unreasonable ideas without having to deal with anyone else's bullshit for just a few hours. You build up that product with marketing that kills that sense of  enjoyment, they might look for something else.

Chipdogs,">The last 15 or so Call of Duty and Battlefield games would like to have a word with you. And about 5 Far Cry games. And 4 or so Uncharted games. 

You haven't actually played those games have you. 

All the recent Call of Duty games since Sarkeesian have female infantry, the last one even had 50% female enemies which was just retarded. Battlefield 3 had a civilian woman front and center who could magically fight as competently as battle hardened veterans, and who would shrilly scream orders in your ear. 

Amy Hennig, (who writes believable plausible stories and characters) wrote the first Uncharted games. Surprise surprise, when she got booted off the team for not being SJW enough, Uncharted 4 got this ridiculous sub plot about an invincible woman who couldn't even be beaten by two shredded 6 foot men.

>You can't even play as her in Wolfenstein. Is your masculinity really so frail that the mere *sight* of a strong women causes you to get upset? 

lol nice buzzword there, you're totally not a mindless cultist guzzling the kool aid are you?

Shoehorning ""strong women"" into a story about male soldiers fighting a war makes it trashy and campy. The writers are saying hey, we've built this dark violent world with death and war, but it's also an unrealistic candyland where women are magically as physically strong as men.

If these writers were really interested in creating interesting memorable female characters, they'd write the women with realistic strengths and weaknesses, who use their intelligence and empathy to solve problems. It's cool and exciting watching realistic female characters creatively get around the limitation of their physical weakness and lack of combat ability. Real women can't use violence and physical strength to solve their problems. They have to be smart instead.

>I find it amusing that women put up with playing *dozens* of games where they have to play a man, but even the mere sight of a women causes male gamers to melt down. 

Overemotional much? Yes, because I'm ""male gamers"" and this calm discussion is a ""melt down"". Do you ever think for yourself or is everything you write sucked straight from some feminist pseudoscience tract?

Women don't ""put up with"" anything, they don't play violent shooters like Wolfenstein in any significant number. The vast majority of videogames are gender neutral. Women have have a ton of games and entertainment media that appeal to them. There is no reason to pander to them. It's ok for men to have some things to themselves.",2017-10-27 21:22:49,3,102

Depending on one of the choices you make, there's an optional cutscene with a black member of the resistance, ""J"" (who seems to have been based on Jimi Hendrix) in the game. In it, J talks about the racism he and his father felt, even before the war, in 1930s-40s America. He expresses his hatred for ""the man"", and ends up calling the main character, Blazko, little different from the Nazis to him.

Then Blazko (obviously) gets pissed, J talks about how violence is the weapon of the man, they bond over both playing guitar, both pop LSD, and Blazko listens to J rocking out.

Nazis.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally gymnastic bigotry. Over, and over, and overall for nothing more than a little promise of a solely white world.

We'll commit ourselves to doing things others would consider crimes against humanity, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time regurgitating bullshit to produce fictional stereotypes all to hide our own terrible insecurities.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the hate, all day, the same bad arguments over and over, hundreds of times to the point where everyone else knows every little detail such that some have attained such anti-Nazi nirvana that they can literally repeat our garbage verbatim.

Do these people have any idea how many of our faces have been smashed, brains over heated, relationships and careers destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to in a poorly edited youtube video?


These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're been building a new one without them. They take our heroes? Nazis aren't shy about throwing their money at other grifters, or even making shit content ourselves. They think calling us racist, misogynistic, incels is going to change us? We've been called worse things by every self-respecting woman with standards. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown extra sensitize to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition we've brought upon ourselves. Who take it as a slight when they tell us we no longer matter as much as we used to. Our obsession with other races after being told we're equal is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with decent people laughing at how pathetic we still are that proving you people right has become a very real fear; an economic anxiety

Nazis are assholes, cowards, by nature. We hate a challenge to our sensitivities. The best thing we did in all of this was to expose ourselves. Weâ€™re not special, weâ€™re not original, weâ€™re not the first; this is just another Third Reich.

You can sorta ignore the old classic 2D Wolfenstein games. Frankly the most important plot point there is ""You play as B.J. Blazkowicz and you killed Hitler."" If you're looking to see the creation of FPSes as a genre tho, it's a really cool game.

One game you could start with 2001's Return to Castle Wolfenstein. It's a pretty good game, and sets up who Deathshead is.

There's also 2009's Wolfenstein. The New Order is actually a sequel to this game. That said, it may be hard to find now as it was actually published by Activision rather than Bethesda and they're prolly regretting letting that IP go. The game itself is also not quite as good as the others, even with some unique ideas.

The best is honestly Wolfenstein: The New Order. It does a good job helping players who didn't get into the other games while still being a blast to play. I think it sort of got helped by basically being one of like three good games that came out in 2014 (that was a shit year for games), but it's probably the best Wolfenstein game.

There are unsavoury people everywhere but you're very unlikely to see white supremacists, neonazis and the like at a democratic party rally; the democrats haven't supported policies they've liked for at least fifty years now.

You've got to ask one question: Why have these groups only been showing up rather recently and only really at Trump-related events?

Why have they been holding more events of their own where they primarily support Trump?

Why do they say 'Hail Trump' while doing the Nazi salute?

I've *never* seen a communist at a democratic event praising Stalin, Mao or any other communist dictator that slaughtered millions.

Modern Communists disavow those people as dictators who perverted the Communist cause for their own gain. They took advantage of the massive centralisation of power and wrought great harm upon their people.

Darthelmet1,"There's a bit of a difference here with the gamer analogy. People choosing to defend Nazi-ism are making a choice to specifically associate themselves with an ideology and everything that comes with it and deserve to be judged for those views. 


Plenty of people, myself included, would call themselves' ""gamers,"" or at least would be labeled as such by others, while not supporting/engaging in a lot of the toxicity. But growing up, we've all had more than our fair share of bullying lobbed at us for something that would broadly fall into this identity category. We've always been the weirdos, the ones who are being given dangerous ideas from games, etc. So forgive me if I'm not comfortable with a bunch of people coming in (at lot of whom I'd assume would have either been on the side of the bullies or at least a neutral party) and painting everyone like me with a broad brush when I'm already carrying those social stigmas from when I was a kid. The argument wasn't exactly framed as ""Some people who play games, as you'd expect from any population, are toxic and it'd be nice if they weren't."" It was more along the lines of ""This hobby is toxic and the men who enjoy it are all manbabies and if you don't want to be labeled one you should distance yourself from it as much as possible.""


I was in college around when GG was happening. I wasn't really involved in much of the conversation beyond just watching videos about the mess, but during my anthro class, when it came up that I liked games, my professor asked me about the whole GG situation as if I was supposed to answer for it somehow. 


It isn't good enough for me to just leave it be and say ""oh I guess that's not me, so I don't really have to pay attention to it."" 


Honestly it's late and I don't know where I was going with this. I just don't like the idea of a bunch of ""normal/socially acceptable"" people coming into the only refuge I had from people like them as a kid, then punching down at their former bully targets and acting like they're punching up at their idea of the white male patriarchy.

Gamegate started with people having an outcry against nepotism in games journalism (the whole Zoe Quinn/Depression Quest thing).

It has since evolved into the whole ""anti-SJW"" thing it is now...but originally it wasn't anything even related to that.

Funny  thing is, ethics in games journalism is still a huge problem, but Gamergate's evolution into what it is now steered the discussion away from that. But it may be for the best since the initial  reasons for gamergate were based on lies told by a malicious ex. ",2017-10-06 20:53:14,-3,

That the people who try to protect different religions are a bit less like the nazis than the group who paints muslims as evil, who say that muslims are trying to immigrate into western society so that they can eventually seize power here. Who paint muslims as a religion that is incompatible with our society, that we must keep out the muslims, or even deport them. (Hmm, sounds vaguely familiar, I don't know why...)

Hate groups when viewed by a rational person are just that hate groups.

The Nazi's needed desperate people to gain power, they needed people who felt attacked, who felt persecuted to gain power. 

But hey... I suppose real world example of why we shouldn't give the groups exactly what want is just me being an edgelord.

ISIS attacks France for propoganda and to get France to respond to attack moderate mosques, to implement anti-muslim laws. So that those moderate muslims who wouldn't hurt a sole are now pushed to the extreme, to those who haven't attacked them directly. To those who offer religious freedom.

Nazis.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally gymnastic bigotry. Over, and over, and overall for nothing more than a little promise of a solely white world.

We'll commit ourselves to doing things others would consider crimes against humanity, because we think it's fun.
We'll spend most if not all of our free time regurgitating bullshit to produce fictional stereotypes all to hide our own terrible insecurities.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the hate, all day, the same bad arguments over and over, hundreds of times to the point where everyone else knows every little detail such that some have attained such anti-Nazi nirvana that they can literally repeat our garbage verbatim.

Do these people have any idea how many of our faces have been smashed, brains over heated, relationships and careers destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to in a poorly edited youtube video?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're been building a new one without them. They take our heroes? Nazis aren't shy about throwing their money at other grifters, or even making shit content ourselves. They think calling us racist, misogynistic, incels is going to change us? We've been called worse things by every self-respecting woman with standards. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown extra sensitize to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition we've brought upon ourselves. Who take it as a slight when they tell us we no longer matter as much as we used to. Our obsession with other races after being told we're equal is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with decent people laughing at how pathetic we still are that proving you people right has become a very real fear; an economic anxiety

potpan0,"I skim read the Wikipedia article on this, so I'm obviously an expert.

The First Klan, established following the Civil War, was fairly large. They claimed to have over 500,000 members. However, the organisation was very disorganised and autonomous, and was largely used to settle local disputes rather than promote a specific platform. In 1870, however, the KKK was designated a terrorist organisation, and gradually fell out of favour.

The Second Klan, established following the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation, was much larger. By 1924 they had between 1.5-4 million members, which was 4-15% of the eligible population (white protestants). The Second Klan was much more organised. However, into the late 1920s and early 1930s, they fell out of favour again due to internal leadership controversies. 

The Third Klan (which the modern klans stem from) came into prominence in the 1950s and 1960s in response to the Civil Rights Movement. I can't find figures for their membership in that period, but I don't think it was anywhere near the 1920s membership.  ",2017-10-06 17:31:01,25,

chikius,"Your LGBT analogy doesn't work. In one case we have a sub actively violating Reddit rules, in other case... Well, not that.


If LGBT subs were deleted, that wouldn't be censorship either. Reddit would rightfully be accused of being a bigoted shit-hole, and of supressing LGBT voices, but it wouldn't be censorship. Words have specific meanings. 


For past decade, we've had this resurgence of free-speech martyrs who see censorship in everything. What's really (usually) happening is some asshat makes a fool of themselves publicly and gets fired. 


That is not censorship. we can't afford to devalue that word in current era where actual fascists are on the rise. It must be clear to everyone that what Erdogan is doing is actual censorship. He's actually arresting people who disagree with him, not urging Facebook to delete someone's account because they sent rape threats to a disabled 80 year old woman.


Or look at what Trump's administration has been doing to EPA. That *is* actual censorship.


Now to the weird SRS bit. SRS is without a doubt a hate-sub, I don't see why you'd think I'd be against banning them too.


If two subs are violating rules the solution isn't to ban neither since you can't ban only one of them. You just ban both of them. How is this not obvious.",2017-10-06 15:23:48,22,

Donald Trump said there are ""very fine people"" in a protesting group of white supremacists, and neo-Nazis. That's literally it. That was the protest. It was a white supremacist protest.

Are you comparing that statement to one made about all of America?

Secondly, I haven't said anything about you. And your post confused me because it was written with a very poor grasp of English. Whether that's due to it not being your first language, or whatever, the point remains that it's unreadable.

And finally, _you_ still haven't posted any evidence whatsoever about communist or socialist politicians or rallies. Yet you're saying _I'm_ the one afraid of a reasonable discussion?

Let's continue here. It's a fact that there are significant neo-Nazis rallies in America. It's a fact that the POTUS refuses to condemn them and enjoys major support from the alt-right, which includes neo-Nazis and white supremacists as a very significant part of their membership.

Video games are fundamentally an interactive medium, unlike books, TV, movies, film, and most other forms of art which are passive mediums. In that way, a video game is more like a toy. It has mechanics which you play with. The game's story justifies the mechanics and decorates its conditions for success and failure in an accessible way. In Mario: you go right, jumping pitfalls, and stomp goombas, so you can beat Bowser and rescue Peach. It's so pure, and so successful.

Obviously that's not universally true. Games can be more and do more. But I think many games fail when they start fighting against the medium.",2017-08-26 19:01:26,3,248
sapphon,"Carmack tried to redefine 'game' as 'arcade game' because during his time they were close enough, and games with stories could be dismissed as interactive novels (i.e. not real games, i.e. No True Scotsman fallacy)

I think thinking about them hierarchically (i.e. one's primary and one's secondary) is probably just wrong.  This example will get long, I'm afraid.

Shadowrun Hong Kong's epilogue is a roleplaying game about a privatized [used future](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture) in which corporations control all aspects of most people's lives.  It's a really typical and unimaginative RPG in a lot of ways: you have a party, its members have roles, they're aided in those roles by skills, items, and weapons...etc.  These skills might help in combat, or conversation, or in technical endeavors, etc. Par.  For.  The.  Fucking.  Course.

So in this game, just like in Mass Effect or your favorite recent RPG, solutions are usually smashed over the player's head like a Ming vase.  If your character has the skills or items to be Smart About Something, you get the added button in a dialog to Use That Skill and Do The Smart Thing.  Charisma lets you charm people, Strength lets you intimidate them.  Having the same high skills they do lets you engage in shop-talk, which can be revealing.  You don't have to make a plan ahead of time, though.  The game will show you the way.

Cue the mission 'Detention', which hearkened back to 20th-century RPG tradition - let the player think of it, then let the character execute it.  If the player's not thinking, what is he doing back there?  It also infuriated a lot of people - [this is](http://www.popmatters.com/review/shadowrun-hong-kong-shadows-of-hong-kong/) the top Google result for 'shadowrun hong kong epilogue' =P

You're presented with waves of enemies you probably can't defeat.  There's no button you can press, item you can use, or Clever Conversational Zinger you can use to change these facts.  

If you're used to WRPGs and being able to Find The Hidden McGuffin to Make the Combat Easier you're just in trouble.  If you're used to JRPGs and Boss Fights and fight as hard as you can, using all your consumables... *you're still going down*.

The only way to win is to have a realization *about the game's story*.  Spoilers follow.

Remember I said the game was about a privatized future?  Government is extremely weak, and corps have no reasons to keep their feuds quiet if they feel they have enough to gain.  The enemies are from *two different corporations* who each want what you have. They hate each other, and if they can't find you, they'll fight amongst themselves.  All you have to do is kill a few directly in your way, then step towards a secluded area of the map and grab your popcorn.

This little trick on the devs' part wouldn't be possible if people weren't used to story taking a back seat to mechanics, I agree. However, that means it feels even better when story and gameplay interact together to make a more believable world that the player needs to engage with as more than just 'a video game' to succeed.",2017-08-26 19:12:38,1,249

There is a positive correlation between times of racial tension and the erection of civil war memorials, they are used as assertions of white superiority and identification with the aims of the civil war.

The belief that people should be denied personhood for any reason, but in this instance based on race, is abhorrent. There is a thin line between white nationalism and nazism.

There is no historical revisionism in removing statues; statues are not the only medium through which history is taught. In a sense, we could regard the statues as themselves being historically revisionist by lionising people who fought to continue to enslave black people.

Because, quite simply, when it comes to Nazis: ""both are bad"" isn't enough of a sentiment. Unfortunately, it's a common tactic within the Alt-Right: equivocate as a smokescreen. But it really shouldn't be difficult to say: ""violence on both sides is bad, but more importantly, Nazis are awful.""

> So why are the people on the other side ""nazis""?

Because people were waving their flag, and the ""Kekistan"" aesthetic is a blatant homage to it. If they aren't actually Nazis, they're definitely trying to be.

And I don't see American AntiFa corralling under any specific flag. The group, if we can even call it that, is anarchic and reactionist. It doesn't seem deliberately political outside of ""not Nazi.""

Because we're not trying to apply the label in terms of governance. Given the advent of Neo-Nazis, I'd say that Neo-Nazi = Nazi = White Supremacist is a reasonable transitive assumption.

OK? Assuming you're correct, that's a pointlessly semantic victory. But you aren't because, like I said, the Alt-Right movement is intentionally and quite flagrantly waving Nazi iconography.

Is that so bad? Neither white supremacy nor Nazism is acceptable. If Nazi is the only word that'll get people to care, we might as well use it regardless of semantics.

I seriously question the morality of just throwing people suffering from a mental illness under the bus. As long as they don't actually victimize anyone, paedophiles need, more then anything, mental health support and counseling, not ostracism and hatred.

I take it you're unaware of the period of history I'm referring to, then?

The paedophile movement specifically attempted to piggy-back off gay rights, and specifically used the reasoning that if gay rights were okay, so was paedophilia (ironically, this is the same reasoning the most hateful elements of the right use to oppose gay rights).

At the same time as this was going on, homosexuality was listed as a mental disorder, and indeed was well into the 1980s or possibly even 1990s, if I remember correctly. That was kind of a separate fight.

> Replace ""neo-nazi"" with any other group, and understand this is what you're setting the precedent for. I'm jewish, and even I recognize that free speech protections weren't designed to protect popular speech. The solution to abhorrent ideas is public debate and truthful examination, not censorship that does nothing but drive this shit into the shadows, where it can grow and fester like a cancer.
Let the nazis have their demonstrations. Let there be counter demonstrations. But don't try to beat, literally or figuratively, the other side into accepting your position. It literally never works, and has never worked.

This is a naive sentiment, I would suggest, because you're assuming beliefs like these are rationally held and capable of ""truthful examination"" and worthy of ""public debate"", even though they are deeply harmful. The fact is, neo-nazi-type beliefs, just like eugenic beliefs, were completely irrational, and protected by a veil of pseudo-scientific or psuedo-rational nonsense, but that veil was thick enough that many members of the public and even a lot of well-educated people, could not penetrate it. Certainly the people buying into it were no more possible to reason with than Sandy Hook deniers or Chemtrail idiots.

I would add that a particularly bad problem today, one that exacerbates these issues so severely that perhaps, were it not the case, I would agree with your position, is this idea of ""fair and balanced reporting"", where we have to give ""both sides"" equal time and opportunity to express their position. This is appalling, frankly, on a variety of levels.

First off, it pre-supposes there are ""sides"", destroying nuance, destroying shades of opinion, and promoting extreme beliefs.

Second off, it gives a false equivalence between positions, which misleads and confuses many people, including some intelligent people. A person who holds a completely irrational and baseless belief, perhaps even one that is paranoid and literally insane, should not be treated as an equal to someone with a solidly reasonable, rational or well-evidence scientific position. Yet they are, constantly.

Well, I had more to say but I've lost my train of thought. I believe that the reality is, though, as a society, we need to be able to actually have debates be resolved if we want to be able to move forwards any further (rather than being some dodgy neoliberal society for the rest of eternity). Continually allowing the right (and it is always the right) to re-open issues that should have been resolved fifty, a hundred, or even five hundred+ years ago is hugely damaging to society and progress. Identity politics being so prevalent in the US, and dominating much of the political conversation (esp. on the left) is the product not of the left obsessing about this stuff (though it does, at times), but rather the right continually attempting to set back really simple, straightforward issues like ""racism is bad"" or ""homosexuals should not be victimised"". No amount of ""rational debate"" is going to convince a bunch of ""bible-believing"" (i.e. New Testament-ignoring) quasi-Christian state senators and congressmen that it's okay to be gay. Only force or the threat of force stops such people and policies - usually political, judicial, or economic force rather than physical force, thankfully. 

I do understand the concerns re: other groups being affected, but you yourself suggested West Germany dealt with neo-nazism well (or seemed to, correct me if I'm wrong), and I think so long as care is exercised, banning certain abhorrent ideas from the public sphere is not outrageous or certain to lead to dictatorships or oppression - especially not as compared to certain other ideas (like untrammeled state invasion of private conversation, which both the left and right gleefully support - only uni-directionally, of course, with the state able to examine all private conversations, but citizens unable to examine the workings of the state and their supposed representatives).",2017-08-27 15:25:02,1,542
Eurehetemec,"> Looking at how both West and East Germany dealt with converting the population away from fascism and Nazism, I find that the way the West handled it was more effective.

I would agree 100%. Expressing Nazi ideology, engaging in Nazi or neo-nazi activities, owning Nazi memorabilia/uniforms etc., and so on were strictly illegal in West Germany and still are in the unified Germany. You could, and still can, and people do, go to jail for expressing those kinds of beliefs. Whereas East Germany had terrifying secret police and secret courts and people being disappeared and so on for anyone who disagreed with the state, which was much more extreme and downright horrifying and monstrous (and, ironically, not far from the Nazis...).

Whereas the US have always seen those things as just fine. Honestly, pre-WW2, if it wasn't for Roosevelt's leadership (if, say, he'd died early), the US could have ended up as a full-on fascist state. Even post WW2, when in Europe Nazi ideology in all aspects was seen as debunked and defunct, Nazi-esque stuff continued on in the US - insane eugenics stuff particularly.

We already know what happened last time Nazis and white nationalists had significant power.  The Confederacy, the Third Reich, and, to a lesser extent, the Jim Crow South, were horrifying, and resulted in both horrific loss of life, human rights violations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.  In fact, that's where the term ""Crimes against Humanity"" came from; the Nurmburg Trails, where the few surviving members of the Nazi leadership were put to a fair trail.  Which was far more than they ever gave their victims.  The US was very forgiving of the Confederacy, mass pardoning the traitors after the 1870s.  The rule of law instituted by these ex-Confeds resulted in the Jim Crow South, where lynchings and murders of innocent people were common, just for the amount of melanin in their skin.

a) Most counter-protestors are most definitely not Antifa, through antifa people may join the protests or organize a protest. 

b) Antifascism traditionally dates back to around Germany before Hitler took power, when the fascist movements were on their sunrise. Antifa is traditionally a weird coalition between anarchists, socialists, communists (and practically, probably some left liberals) etc with the goal to hampen reactionary efforts. In my area for example, they are currectly organizing to protect a sit-in by immigrants against a Nazi/Nationalist counter rally. 

You can find all sorts of people withhin an antifa group, but they will most likely be anti-capitalists (the classic red and black antifa symbol symbolizes the alliance between the anarchist section and the marxist section)

c) The most important point: Antifa doesn't have ""leadership"". It's a very autonomous method of organization - fascist things are planned, antifa start to spread it around on their social  medias groups for awareness, and then they group up and show up to hampen the fascists. 
If you see anything like "" Antifa Texas"" proclaiming something, or whatever else that pretends to be an official Antifa account - disregard it as a most likely fake. That's not how it is organized.

Eurehetemec,"Sure, but I think it's a little more complex than ""It's just a mental illness!"", as appealing as that idea might. There are clearly a *lot* of people who commit pedophilic acts who do not ""broken brains"" as it were. Sleazy, creepy, opportunistic people (mostly men, for obvious reasons, but otherwise they can be rich or poor, black or white, Christian or Muslim or whatever - though being a religious fundamentalist - of any religion - seems to make it WAY more likely), who take advantage of the fact that kids are vulnerable to abuse them, because they're unable to easily abuse adults, because they're not vulnerable in the same way. These people *aren't* born with some kind on inescapable compulsion. They're not living their lives in fear - except for of any crimes they've committed. So I would be cautious in advancing a ""they just can't help it!"" defence too widely. There are others who, often due to abuse they themselves suffered a very young age, have serious mental problems and compulsions and indeed need help and caring. I don't think there's ANY evidence to support the idea that anyone is a ""born pedophile"". I've never seen a study that supports that. There's no animal analogy (unlike with homosexuality, where there's clear evidence that some people are ""born gay"" - and the same applies to some fraction of animals, particularly mammals), either, that I'm aware of.

You basically just have these two groups: opportunists/predators, and victims of abuse (obviously there's considerable crossover too). I'm pretty sure the former group is the larger one, too. Should people be able to seek help? Yes absolutely. If they have dangerous or upsetting impulses of any kind (not just of these kinds), they should be encouraged to seek help, and not horribly stigmatized if they get help before hurting people or committing crimes. We should have a strong mental health system ready and waiting to help them. In the UK, we do have a decent one - it needs improvement, but it does deal with precisely this kind of thing. In the US, that's not really case, nor is likely to be until mental health issues become destigmatized, which won't happen until the US becomes less religious, and less individualistic, neither of which is going to happen any time soon.

Should they be allowed to speak out in favour of abusing children? I'm going to say a very firm no on that one. They should be prevented from doing so. They are advocating for vile crimes. Likewise any racist group which is advocating for ethnic cleansing/genocide, for laws controlling intermarriage between the made-up races that exist largely in their heads, and so on - they advocating for crimes, hate, and damage.",2017-09-04 22:03:01,1,648

In the 19th century, capitalists abused and exploited India, Asia, and Africa. They starved and killed millions for their own benefit. British industry was built off of slave labor in the first half of the 19th century. So no, this is not easy. Because it led to the abolishment of serfdom and peasantry in England itself, but it led to slavery, starvation, murder, oppression, and imperialism  in other parts of the world. Capitalism is anything but simple - morally or economically. 

We can argue that yes, maybe billions would've lived in squalor if capitalism didn't exist. I don't disagree, but there's a class of people who live in luxury while others starve (and I don't discount myself - I'm a part of the 2% globally, which makes me poor in America but still better off than the vast majority of others). I've read convincing arguments that capitalist mindsets led to the abolition of slavery. I'm not blind to the good capitalism has done. However, there are still billions living in squalor, who are oppressed, hated, starving, in pain, and dying. We have the resources and technology to make sure that no one starves. Capitalism, for all the good it's done, has committed grave evils, too. Mass starvation and abuses for profit have occurred. For all the evil people like Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and others have committed, their sins are nothing compared to people like Leopold the Second, who abused millions of Africans for his own profit. 

This is hard. It's very hard. History is hard. And frankly, as the west has to contend with a rising Asia and India, we're going to need to answer for these sins. We've done evil to these places, especially Britain and France. Living in ignorance will not help us. It is not a solution. It is time to see that we need to admit to our sins and work to create a better world where no one starves, where everyone has a home, where people can find decent work. That, I think, is the promise of socialism. That, I think, is what socialists need to work towards. Because most things are socially constructed, things that we learn. We can change what we learn.

>so I don't really know the whole culture around the Confederacy and what not as I'm not even from the Northeast either.

Well, I can help you there! 

I won't go over too in-depth on the Confederacy here, except to say they were secessionists who wanted to break away from the Union to preserve their state's rights to own a specific group of people and treat them as property.

After the war, as a result of Reconstruction policies prohibiting those who served with the Confederacy from holding office, there were very few Confederate monuments.  No less a man than Robert E. Lee himself, said that the Confederacy should remain dead and buried, and that creating monuments to the Confederacy would simply stir up old tensions.  It wasn't until after Reconstruction that you started seeing a brief resurgence of Confederate iconography.  This didn't really pick up steam, however, until during the Jim Crow era of the South, where, with the fading of the memory of the Civil War, Southern historians and groups like Daughters of the Confederacy sought to repaint the war as a glorious ""Lost Cause"".  Not surprisingly, this also coincided with a resurgence in the KKK, which became a massive organization numbering in the tens of millions, in a time where the US population was less than 150 million.  Imagine a country where 10% of the population was a member of the KKK!  This is when the first wave of Confederate monuments was built.  This was big business at the time, as monuments were manufactured and spread all over the South.

The second wave I know less about the details, but it was in direct reaction to the Civil Rights movement, essentially serving to try and remind black people in the South, ""Remember who's really in charge"".  The one in Charlottesville is an example of Confederate monument manufacturing during that time.  

None of the Confederate monuments around today date to during the time of the Confederacy and were manufactured afterward, to spread a mythological idea of a noble Lost Cause, as well as to earn money for neo-Confederate groups.

As for ""honoring his ancestors"", choosing to identify with, plainly speaking, traitors who tried to destroy the United States so they could keep men, women, and children enslaved makes as much sense as a German identifying with the Third Reich.

And if you say it's a ""free speech"" issue, you'll notice that there are no Nazi monuments in Germany, and that country seems to be doing just fine.

Of all these interpretations, the states'-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, states' rights for what purpose? States' rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle.[43]

Yeah, Indians didn't starve because the British deemed them unworthy of life. That didn't exist on the continent. There was no social darwinism before the British brought it. And yes, there was starvation, disease, oppression, and murder. But that's a function of hierarchy that we should all look to destroy. Imperialism added a profit motive for the British. Because it was the British messing with the economy of rural India, demanding that peasants grow cotton instead of food that caused famines. Then, when those famines came, the British ignored it, continued shipping supplies - including food - out and refusing international aid sent to India, justifying it with eugenics. That did not exist before the British came. 

>So it doesn't matter that literally billions are better off, if anyone is still struggling we must immediately end the system that brought those gains in order to bring about fairness?

We can do better though. Billions are better off, but any benefits they gain are marginal compared to what we in the west get from their pain. We're still exploiting them, even if we make their lives ""better.""

Leopold is just one example. Christ, the British government purposefully allowed millions of Indians to die because the British administrator thought they were inferior people. That was a century ago. Do you not think the deaths and exploitation of millions of people for centuries has nothing to do with today? Do you think the effects of empire just ended when the British left? No. You can still finds its scars today.  

>I'm sorry, I'm not willing to sacrifice the greatest engine of human progress ever devised so you can get over your guilt for something nobody alive today did.

Ya, there's no way Western companies pay employees in Asia very little and make huge profits in the U.S. There's no way Africa's still struggling because of imperialism and its horrors. Who is this engine working for anyway? What is progress? 

Beyond that, frankly, I don't feel guilty for what the British did. But that the Chinese view the Opium wars as a great national disgrace will be their problem as China gains strength. I'm not saying that because I feel guilty. I'm saying that because people in the global south will remember how they were treated. Their anger isn't unjustified, either. Besides, ""that nobody alive today did"" is a strange claim when these only ended 60 years ago.

Capitalism and the state are closely tied. The modern ""capitalist"" state is just called a liberal democracy. Liberalism, especially in Europe were the term didn't come to mean center-left, has always meant ""capitalist."" The modern state wouldn't exist without capitalists pushing it, giving it more power over people to enforce things we take for granted like certain ideas about property rights.  

>The difference between capitalism and communism is that for communism to have any chance of working, it must be enforced through government control.

That's why Marxism's end stage (i.e. communism) is a stateless society. Because it requires government control. That's why. Yes. Makes total sense.

>Capitalism, on the other hand, is the opposite, individuals are free to buy, sell and produce what they want, how they want. 

If that's the extent of freedom, sure. But look, you're free to sell your labor to me, and if you don't then you starve. But hey, you're still ""free"" because you're choosing to sell your labor to me. Also if you don't, you starve. But hey, that's freedom! Never mind that you were born into extreme poverty, and I was born into extreme wealth. That doesn't matter. You're free. Free to starve. 

>The government is only involved insofar to ensure that people's rights and health are protected.

That's not a universal claim, and it was socialists who fought for regulations that made food safer. They fought for basic labor rights like the 40 hour work week. They fought for universal education, healthcare, workers rights, children's rights, the rights of people of color and the oppressed more generally. The modern state has been touched by socialism in a variety of ways. 

Besides, how well the government protects peoples' health is questionable. After all, if there's no regulations against dumping toxic industrial waste into the rivers, or they're not enforced, or a major political party that controls all three branches of government just decides that healthy drinking water isn't important, or that climate change isn't a threat then nothing's gonna be done. After all, there is no ""right"" to healthy drinking water. There is no ""right"" to know what's in your food. There aren't many ""rights."" The protections for the vast majority of people (who are easy to bully as individuals because corporations are very powerful, rich, and have interests that go against their own) are laws that were passed against the will of the rich and powerful, because there was popular demand and outrage. Because the state didn't exist for them in the early 20th century. It existed for the rich and powerful. There have been changes, yes, but that core's still there. ",2017-08-29 10:19:59,1,721

It enabled mass upward mobility in societies like the Soviet Union because it ensured education for everyone. And yes, the Soviet Union was flawed, but frankly given its hectic early 20th century, there are much worse outcomes post-Stalin. The same can be said for China. Millions, if not billions, of people who had no hope or chances under older regimes were given opportunities that they never would've had otherwise under other authoritarian regimes like Imperial Russia. No, it wasn't perfect. You'll find plenty of anti-communists, but pretending like it's done nothing good is, again, just ignoring history. 

Edit: Like, there was a reason communism was popular in the 20th century. There were reasons it died down too. There are always critiques that can be made, but acting like it has no value, like it's contributed nothing, like capitalism's innocent is just ignorant. Your dismissive attitude is why people turn towards Revolution because they do not feel like anyone's listening.

>slavery isn't a necessary byproduct of capitalism either, so putting that as a negative of capitalism is disingenuous and misleading.

What's misleading about it? American slavery fed the textile industry in Britain. During the civil war, the British textile industries collapsed because they didn't have enough cotton. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, were out of work because of the American Civil War. This was the era of the industrial revolution. British industry was built on American slavery. Then, after the war, the British used India as its main cotton growing hub. They displaced traditional forms of agriculture like growing food for cotton production. Millions starved. (*Empire of Cotton*, *The Half Has Never Been Told* and *Late Victorian Holocausts* all cover this pretty well - *The Half Has Never Been Told* does a great job at expressing the economics of slavery in particular, while *Empire of Cotton* does a great job stringing a broader historical narrative together. Both are by academic historians. *Late Victorian Holocausts* is just beautifully well written, amazingly well researched, and addresses how British attitudes and behaviors in India led to millions dying through starvation) 

>Also saying that your only options are to either work for someone else or starve is a false assertion.

I mean, I guess you can be a subsistence farmer. But you're either working, an owner, or starving. And not everyone can be an owner. So no, it's not a false assertion. It's just an unpleasant one. 

>No one here said capitalism is perfect, nor cannot be improved, but history has already proven communism to be a complete and abject failure, there's no reason to defend it in this day and age.

There's plenty of reason to defend it. What failed about universal education? What failed about food and safety regulation standards? What failed about improving lives for workers? Yes, the Soviet states didn't work out, but they weren't exactly communist. They embody one vision of socialism that, I agree, failed. But one vision isn't everything. Why don't we talk about authoritarian capitalists states like Chile? Argentina, maybe? Or why don't we talk about the failure of capitalism and liberal democracy in Russia post-1991? Jesus, it was a massive decline in wealth, living standards, and life expectancy. I don't even know if the Russian economy's recovered to where it was. There are plenty examples of capitalism failing too. But no one would say that discredits the whole project.

And don't mistake me for praising the Soviet states. I have a very different vision that is more socially libertarian, one that conflicts with Soviet ideology. But you just don't seem to have much of an idea about socialism, communism, capitalism, or the history or philosophy behind any of it, so I don't see why (or how) I can express it.",2017-08-29 15:01:55,0,757

YOU brought up slavery as a negative of capitalism, despite showing nothing to back up your assertion. Capitalists might have benefited from slavery in the past, but the system does not create nor require slavery to function. In the other hand, it's communism that makes slaves out of its own citizens, who have no choice but to work for their government, doing what they're told or face imprisonment, or worse.

>Like 17th century England.

That's not an example, it's hardly a sentence.

There's nothing about colonial that's unique with capitalism that wouldn't have happened if they were Marxists. In fact, it probably would have been 100x worse if they had been.

>Owner.

Yes, it turns out being an owner, or a self made man, isn't actually that hard!

Finally, despite all your claims and the claims of Marxists, communism doesn't actually care about the lower class, or the poor. In fact saying so is such a bald faced lie when faced with the fact that these are always the first peyote to have their freedoms stripped away from them under communist rule, while (surprise surprise!) The rich elites still sit high and dry.

Facts like what? You haven't linked to any facts. You've linked to a psychology professor who only thinks he knows shit, a propaganda organization, and wikipedia. Those aren't facts. I've given historians. I've given people who've studied this topic. And that you even think you can give ""facts"" on a topic like this, again, just shows your ignorance. It's an argument. Arguments are comprised of facts, but they're not facts themselves because facts can be interpreted differently. Like Peterson, you just think you know shit. 

Do you even know what a dialectic is? What the base, substructure is? Do you know how they work? Do you know where Marx believes culture originates from? Do you know what Marx believed about capitalism, how it affected feudalism? No. It's clear you don't. You just think ""Wow, people died under communism, so clearly it's bad"" when you ignore how capitalists in India, Asia, and Africa straight up slaughtered millions. 

>YOU brought up slavery as a negative of capitalism, despite showing nothing to back up your assertion.

I referenced academic historians. If that's not backing up what I say then I don't know what is. 

>Capitalists might have benefited from slavery in the past, but the system does not create nor require slavery to function.

Capitalism needed slavery to take off. I'm sorry, but facts don't care about your feelings. If you want to point to communism's failures as having mass killings then you need to accept that capitalism's failures including slavery. Because like it or not, it happened. It was critical to the process of developing capitalism. Imperialism came after because capitalists still needed resources, but they couldn't get them cheaply or in the quantity needed from Americans. So they turned to India. They turned to Africa. They turned to Asia. They broke down, beat, abused, and killed people for profit. They caused mass starvation because they forced people to grow cotton instead of food, then refused to import any food to help when famine came. They then justified it using racial theories.  

>That's not an example, it's hardly a sentence.

It's the time period when it happened. It's an answer. It doesn't need to be a sentence. Don't get pissy because you're so mad you can't always form coherent ideas.

>In the other hand, it's communism that makes slaves out of its own citizens, who have no choice but to work for their government, doing what they're told or face imprisonment, or worse.

Not really. People are paid, after all. The goal was that everyone would have a job. It eventually turned into ""you're not allowed to not work if you're able,"" but given the choice between starvation and working for the government (a real problem for people, especially in the late 19th and early 20th century), what would you chose? Yes, people who didn't want to work were considered delinquents. In the U.S., we're happy to just call them lazy and say they deserve to be homeless, even if they have a mental illness that prevents them from holding a stable job. No one was threatened with death for not working though except maybe during WWII which, faced with what the Soviet Union was faced with, any nation would do the same. 

Certainly the Soviet Union employed slave labor through the gulags. Most people sent there didn't deserve it. They were soldiers who were captured or political dissidents. It was wrong and horrific. But that's very different from ""everyone who's able must have a job."" 

>There's nothing about colonial that's unique with capitalism that wouldn't have happened if they were Marxists. In fact, it probably would have been 100x worse if they had been.

Yes, the extraction of resources for European industry has nothing to do with capitalism. That's 100% correct. Again, it's clear you don't know history or Marxism, especially considering Marxist-Leninism is explicitly anti-imperialist. It's almost like anti-imperialism the reason it was popular in China and Vietnam, in Africa, in Latin America. 

>Yes, it turns out being an owner, or a self made man, isn't actually that hard!

So everyone can be a self-made man? There's no need for workers, then? Just one person can do everything in a business?  Wow, that's really impressive. I can't believe Walmart's run by just one person who does all the jobs there. 

>Finally, despite all your claims and the claims of Marxists, communism doesn't actually care about the lower class, or the poor. In fact saying so is such a bald faced lie when faced with the fact that these are always the first peyote to have their freedoms stripped away from them under communist rule, while (surprise surprise!) The rich elites still sit high and dry.

Eh. Debatable. The Soviet Union was a technocracy. It didn't matter if someone was born ""poor,"" i.e. to subsistence farmers. They were given the opportunity to go to college and become engineers and move up the ranks in society. Certainly, the Soviet Union did some horrible things to ""kulaks"" or richer peasants. I won't deny it. Stalin was a horrible person. He's the antithesis of everything I support. But I don't know why you're so stuck on the Soviet Union or China as the only visions of communism. There's an ideological continuity there because the Soviet Union supported communist revolutions, and they had a way of going about it. They didn't like groups who broke from their vision. They crushed anarchist communes in Ukraine, for example, because they didn't like challenges to their vision of communism. There were places like Yugoslavia that were communist and not in the Soviet sphere of influence. 

And yeah, there were rich elites. In China, it happened because they adopted a more capitalist approach. In the Soviet Union, it happened because Stalin killed off anyone who could lead after him, leading to an inner-circle who just promoted themselves. When a younger man reached power, i.e. Gorbachev, loans taken during the 80's in Eastern European countries led to massive debt problems there. He wanted reformed, but it failed because the Soviet Union could not afford to subsidize those countries. The economic problems led to a pretty peaceful revolution (led by Yeltsin) who declared a Russian republic. The economy policies embraced after completely destroyed life in Russia because the elites ran off with the industry, becoming capitalists. So at the very worst, you can say that communism ends up like capitalism. And I don't disagree. After all, my vision is one of reform towards a goal where there aren't elites. I don't see why you want to just stick that to the Soviet Union and its vision. I don't deny its problems, but I don't see why the goal of a more equal world needs to be abandoned just because the Soviet Union sucked. Capitalism fuckin' sucks too. I'm not going to give up because people died. People died under capitalism, just for profit.  

Again, I can recommend some books about this subject:

*The Red Flag* is pretty good. It's about the history of communism. It's very long, but it's an evenhanded treatment of communism. It shows the upsides and downsides. It shows who liked it and who disliked it and why. It shows its failures and successes.  

*Empire of Cotton* is an amazing book about the history of capitalism. It shows how slavery and imperialism mixed to help create capitalism. I'm getting most of my info from this book. I'd seriously recommend going to check it out. 

*The Half Has Never Been Told* deals with slavery in the United States and the ways it was turned industrial, using brutal techniques to force slaves to work faster and pick more cotton.

*Late Victorian Holocausts* deals with British expansion into India and the way they used the climate and starvation to their advantage. It's also beautifully well written. 

What stuns me is that you don't think I'm aware of the mass killings or violence under communism. I am. I've studied and read about this subject. I've read about environmental issues. I've read about social issues. I've read about its failures to eliminate hierarchy (or in the S.U.'s case, how it was re-implemented). I understand all that, yet I still support trying to create a better society because giving up isn't the answer. The British certainly didn't after they lost their supply of cotton. They never said ""Welp, time to go back to the farm."" No. They found another source, they changed their industries. I don't see why socialists can't do the same. There are other ideas. There are unexplored avenues that don't even require overthrowing the state and creating revolution (the main problem with Marxist-Leninism, imo) and mass violence. I say that you don't have an imagination because you can't imagine things not turning out like they did in the Soviet Union. But frankly, I don't think that's the issue for you. Chances are, our society privileges you. You don't want to lose that. And to that, I say too bad. ",2017-08-30 19:13:57,1,768
