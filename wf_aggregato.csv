If you absolutely can't help it, at least be so kind and take a deep breath before you comment and don't give in to the rage. Be a Sith elsewhere, don't let the hatred flow through you.

Say what you will about Trump or his supporters, they're *not Nazis*. Like, *literal Nazis*. I'm sure there's a few here and there but that's not exactly the ideology being propagated. I find it hard to believe that 99% of the controversy is coming from *Nazis* and not people pissed off that they're being treated as if they're somehow related to modern history's largest proponents of genocide.

Saying things like ""*I can't believe that this is a controversial topic*"" is frankly intellectually bankrupt from how blatant the messaging is.

Wolfenstein has always been about that over-the-top Nazi slaughter, because nobody that's completely right in the head supports actual Nazism. They've always been the easiest target to dehumanize because of the atrocities associated with them. There's nothing inherently wrong with making a joke out of a political slogan that's used by people you disagree with. However it's certainly distasteful in the current climate to use a politically charged topic to boost your ad campaign.

To those that say the slogan is simply coincidence, you're being rather silly. It's blatantly poking fun at MAGA. Even if, through somehow bizarre circumstance it wasn't intentional, it could easily be taken as such. If something as innocuous as a color scheme and a graphic design with the smallest of resemblance to a stupid meme can put Bungie over the coals, then it's rather hypocritical not to hold Bethesda to the same standards for ""accidentally"" making reference to a controversial political slogan to advertise their game.

Calling someone a Nazi or a fascist these days is just a trendy derogatory term, which detracts of nuance. Understandably, that's how culture works sometimes.

My point is this: Nazism refers to a political party (and ideology of said party), and fascism to a political ideology and structure. Not everyone belonging to those was instantly bad, but most were in one way or another aiding a political movement that pushed for, and did, very bad things.

**Wolfenstein: The  New Order** had a pretty cool hidden theme within a theme, too. Someone who doesn't pay attention just focus on the Nazi slurs, and glorified Nazi killing: that was theme surrounding the *real* post war entertainment industry's depiction of Nazis. Watch war movies up until like, the 80's, and Nazi killing was always glorified, put on a pedestal...

...But there is also a theme about the main character, Blazckowicz. You'll notice that anything and everything he does, no matter how sophisticated, is an extension of killing Nazis or resorting to violence. He's a Nazi killing machine. You have a lot of narration about his childhood and thought processes throughout, and you can see he is a simple minded person, driven purely by impulse, and although he is talented at many things, he is useless unless he puts those skills at killing Nazis. Everyone around him is much more human than him, he is just there to kill Nazis. 

In a way, its kind of a reflection of the player. The player isn't there to make big decisions. He is just there to press a trigger and kill Nazis.

Yes, Nazism is bad and it should always  be resisted, but a man like Blazkowicz is useless without Nazis.

So maybe it's not about giving Nazis the benefit of the doubt, or giving them a free pass. Maybe it's about how bad glorifying violence itself is, regardless of the target (even if sometimes necessary). Maybe it is about being nuanced, so we don't turn into a Blazkowicz, because at one point or another, the Nazis and the war will be gone, and if all you have is a hammer, all your problems start looking like nails.",2017-10-06 18:02:00,31,

191,191.0,predalienmack,"""Nazis and people who oppose Nazis are the same thing!"" - many liberals, from both sides of the aisle, on reddit and in real life. Trump echoes the same messaging, without really going out of his way to condemn white supremacists and Nazis specifically, simply because he knows they are a *part* of his baseline supporters, rather than doing so on the principle that free speech is important (which is the little understood issue that liberals try to fall back on despite their lack of understanding of Popper's Paradox and the fact that speech is never really free of consequences). The argument that Nazis and Nazi-opposition are both the same is so tired and asinine. Potential genocidal oppressors and people who fight back against potential genocidal oppressors are not the same thing! People have the right to defend themselves against the rise of a genocidal ideology, no matter what society arbitrarily defines as legal or illegal! 

Antifa is a leaning that is about opposing fascism when it shows its face in the streets. It is not an organization and it does not have a specified set of tactics, whether they be violent or not. It is a historical movement that literally started with people opposing Nazis in the streets as they rose to power in what became Nazi Germany. Liberals ignored them and their warnings then, and, with liberals never learning a damn thing from history, they are back at it again with the condemnations of antifa now, which only serves to help fascism gain a platform for legitimacy. Any person who would ultimately be affected negatively if fascists took over (which is basically everyone except the most wealthy and privileged, who would likely benefit from fascists being in power) should identify with antifa and the cause behind the leaning. 

That doesn't mean you have to support direct violence against Nazis, as not every member of antifa is violent. However, any basic understanding of history reveals that violence is the most effective tactic to destroy Nazism before it festers and actually gains real political power, let alone after it gains power. 

However, I would add that the vast majority of people who oppose violence against Nazis just so happen to be people who have little to lose by Nazis gaining power, while people of color, lgbtq folks, Jews, communists/anarchists/socialists, etc. all understand the danger Nazis pose to their very existence if they are allowed to gain power and influence, whether that be in the state or in society as a whole. This is why antifa should be supported, even if elements who participate in it act without thinking long term about tactics or public image...because it is not a unified organization with universalized stances on different, outside of the obvious which everyone should be on board with: opposing fascism. The fact of the matter is that opposing a violent ideology with violence historically works. In the case of Nazi Germany, not enough violence was used until it was too late for millions of people, clearly. ",2017-10-07 10:40:51,1,

> Its an interesting cultural shift that leaves me curious. Nazi's used to be our prime baddies that we could take a shot at without a care in the world.

It's quite simple, ""Nazi's"" are no longer Nazi's, they are regular, normal and perfectly reasonable people who simply do not hold the ""correct"" political opinion. When people talk about ""shooting Nazi's"" in games now you can no longer safely assume they are talking about the absurd caricature of evil they once represented, now it could be your next door neighbor simply because he said immigrants should come in legally and we shouldn't just indiscriminately let anyone into the country (something that was just common sense till about 3 years ago...).

The cultural shift isn't interesting, it's actually quite banal. it's exactly what you would expect to happen when you foster an environment where name-calling with no logical backing is not only common place, it's considered perfectly reasonable action for a god damn presidential candidate of the united states of america. The word has not only lost it's impact for 99% of people, it's become pretty much synonymous with perfectly reasonable, everyday people. So now you are essentially talking about massacring everyone friends, their family, their neighbors, the nice old lady down the street who baked them cookies on the weekends. And what are they supposed to think when someone who was damn near their president called them a bunch of racist, bigoted, homophobic, everything-else-aphobic deplorable?

TL;DR - The world is now so fucking retarded you don't even know if talking about ""shooting nazis"" is a call for indiscriminate lynching of normal every day people or not anymore.

Whether or not you yourself are a Nazi, white supremacist, or still upset about losing the civil war; if you still stand by Donald Trump today, you must accept that you are also standing with those people. They proudly stand behind that man. If that makes you upset to hear. If you are uncomfortable, than maybe step back and reflect on whatâ€™s going on. Because while I wonâ€™t call you a Nazi, you back a man who seems to sympathize with them and that shouldnâ€™t be ok.  ",2017-10-07 09:51:39,0,

Why is no one asking for Star wars to make the first order 'more reasonable'? I mean, they're blatantly based off Nazi Germany.

I mean this is a game in a setting were a tyrannical fascist government takes control of the world. I don't think it's going to be all sunshine and rainbows.

But the man they voted for said some hateful despicable things that should have absolutely precluded his election.   It did not.  

That sends a statement that the times we live in are tenuous and fascism is incredibly insidious.  Remember that it was only the elite Nazis that committed the most heinous of crimes.  Everyone else just played along.   To fight fascism you must have constant vigilance.  You must allow no root of hate or consolidation of national identity to take place.  If anything, the fact that we are so divided is good and necessary.  When we go back to a more rational time, we can begin to have a more rational discourse.  

But for now, dangerous things are being said.  Threats of war are being thrown around.  Races are being demonized for all our societal shortcomings.

It may seem that way at first but then you actually look at the kind of people a group like Antifa calls Nazi's and you quickly realize it's not. Look at the Boston free speech event that was protested for example, they labeled it a Nazi event when there wasn't even a hint of any form of white supremacy, there were multiple jewish speakers in fact. Another example is the Evergreen college situation, you have a guy who dropped out of college to fight for civil rights, somebody who has fought against racism his entire life, even doing research on why it happens to help stop it and they labeled him a white supremacist Nazi because he said no to kicking white people off campus because it's racist (he's also a jew btw).

There were comments sympathizing with the Nazi unironically, and others throwing Nazi insult around when someone would distastefully reference the current administration.

Sure. I think that the left probably holds a near-monopoly on internalized understanding of the paradox of tolerance.

They're not Nazis.

Blows your mind, I'm sure.

>Free speech applies only to the state.

ARE YOU KIDDING? You are 100% wrong here. The state doesn't need the right of free speech, because at any time it has the FORCE to make sure it can say and do whatever it wants. The ordinary citizen does not.

>People do not have to protect free speech

They do because it's they're right to do so, because IT IS THEIR RIGHT. Rights have to be protected or else they mean nothing.

>first amendment is not a guideline for civilians to follow.

Your right, it's not a guideline, it's a founding document that gives American citizens the right of free speech.

>They're people supporting a group that directly advocated for the genocide of any undesirable people.

Ben Shapiro was called a Nazi, even though he's a Jew, and doesn't hold any of the same views as a Nazi (again, he's Jewish, I must repeat). I guess just because they said he is a Nazi I should believe them despite the obvious facts to the contrary? 

>Oh great, the people opposing nazis are the real fascists.

Fascism isn't solely a right wing phenomena, in fact most fascist states in history are arguably leftist ones, these states have killed MILLIONS of their own citizens.

Furthermore, I don't care what a group themselves, I judge them by their actions. No one should support a group that claims to oppose fascism yet by their very actions  would create a more fascist state if they succeed in their goals. 

It's the same reason no one thinks North Korea is a democratic state, even though they're called the ""DEMOCRATIC People's Republic of Korea."" In the same vein, a group that calls itself anti-fascist may not actually be against fascism, just the variety they don't like.

>Impressive considering just in your first paragraph you mention groups ""widely and erroneously"" using the term, then you go and do it yourself.

The important distinction is that I didn't say ALL groups are doing this, just the ones using the term as a blanket excuse for violence.

This is an important distinction. Distinctions are important in this sort of discussion you know.

They considered them misguided because they didn't take race into consideration, which is the core part of the national socialist idea.    
It is a mixture of nationalism and socialism, not just by name but de facto.

But don't trust me on my word, how about Joseph Goebbels himself telling you """"Why are we socialists"", the name of an essay he wrote himself:

>We are socialists because we see in socialism, that is the union of all citizens

>Socialism is the doctrine of liberation for the working class

>The bourgeois is about to leave the historical stage. In its place will come the class of productive workers, the working class, that has been up until today oppressed.

>The bourgeoisie does not want to recognize the strength of the working class.

>We are socialists because we see the social question as a matter of necessity and justice for the very existence of a state for our people

It was indeed planned before Charlottesville, and they took pains to distance themselves from hate grouos. But Charlottesville was why there were so many there. The planned attendance increased exponentially for both the the protestors and the the counter-protestors. Additionally, that was the second ""free speech"" rally in Boston, with the first being organized by those who planned the second as well as other groups who DID attend Charlottesville.

As to Weinstein, the following quote is of interest:
>During the same month, professors also voted on and revised a â€œResolution on Faculty Development in Race and Equity,â€ a document that encouraged educators to â€œreflect on our learning about equityâ€ and â€œintegrate new learning about equity in our teaching practices.â€

After several revisions, 70 faculty members voted in favor of the resolution and only two voted against. One of the dissenting voices was Bret Weinstein.

https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=9722

Note that this link has a lot of stuff defending Weinstein, especially as one of his peers said some pretty awful things. But it can be placed into context when one learns the school had recently been threatened for being a ""communist, scumbag town"". 

Additionally, the ""Day of Absense"" that was the spark at Evergreen is a long-standing voluntary tradition.

Are they *strictly speaking* Nazis? No. And if that is all your point is, I agree and I concede that mislabeling people as Nazis is very bad.

But reality isn't open and shut and the people who made the news for these accusations are likely not good people who are worth defending *other than for their basic human rights guaranteed by the Constitution*. Their actions, intentionally or not, are leading to the spread of the alt-right in this country. And Charlottlesville showed everyone what the alt-right stands for.

The folks at Crimethinc have great response to this point in their ""Free Speech FAQ."" I'll quote it below, but I would recommend reading the whole document as well: https://cloudfront.crimethinc.com/images/rt9/rt9_free_speech_faq.pdf

>*The best way to defeat fascism is to let them express their views so that everyone can see how ignorant they are. We can refute them more effectively with ideas than force.*

>People donâ€™t become fascists simply because theyâ€™re persuaded by their ideas. Fascism claims to offer power to those who feel threatened by shifting social and economic realities. The fact that their analysis of these shifts are ignorant misses the point; do we need to cite examples of how dumb ideas have proved massively popular throughout history? From Italy to Germany to streets around the world today, fascists havenâ€™t gained strength through rational argument, but through organizing to wield power at the expense of others. To counter this, we canâ€™t just argue against them; we have to prevent them from organizing by any means necessary. We can debate their ideas all day long, but if we donâ€™t prevent them from building the capacity to make them reality, it wonâ€™t matter. Only popular self-defense, not simply debate, has succeeded in stopping fascism.

This podcast is also worth listening to if you want to hear more from this side of the debate: https://crimethinc.com/podcast/58

>Should we also punch people who consider people like Stalin or Mao to be their heroes and would gladly purge bourgeoisie?

I'm not a fan of purging any group of people, but I can sympathize with the opinion that the bourgeoisie peddlers of oppression and imperialism (e.g. Dick Cheney, Henry Kissinger, the Koch brothers, etc.) should face punishment for their crimes against humanity. The reason that those types of Stalinists and Maoists have for wanting the bourgeoisie dead are very different and, frankly, more justifiable than the reasons that nazis and fascists call for ethnic cleansing of Jews, blacks, and the other groups of people who they dislike.

>Many pundits have repeated the idea that antifa is a â€œmajor gift to the right.â€ Furthermore, it is often argued that without antifa, the far right would simply wither away. In fact, the Alt Right grew exceptionally well before it faced organized street opposition. It is far from clear that the movement has grown in size due to the clashes, but there is abundant evidence that it has been hurt by them.After Yiannopoulosâ€™s February talk in Berkeley was cancelled, the resulting media glare brought attention to his unsavory views on underage sex. As a result, his book deal was canceled and he is no longer a sought-after speaker for the Right. The aftermath of Charlottesville may have broken the back of the Alt Rightâ€™s fascist wing. The street-fighting with antifascists caused the rally itself to be canceled. Afterward, the Far Right suffered many material losses: Nazi websites have been knocked off the internet; nationwide marches canceled; leaders have been arrested for felonies; and numerous digital platforms canceled accounts. Richard Spencerâ€™s AltRight.com sees Charlottesville as a major defeat and is now advocating the clandestine â€œleaderless resistanceâ€ strategy because they feel it is pointless to organize openly.Itâ€™s evident that public resistance works when confronting far-right groups, and antifa are not the left-wing terrorists despite how they have been portrayed.

Any communist regime, on the other hand, rests on an interpretation of Marx and Engels' theory, and a political leadership that may believe the stuff they are saying, or they may think that communism is a good way to maintain or seize power for themselves. The ideas contained in the Communist Manifesto haven't really been put into practice, there has not been, in modern history, a fully socialist society, i.e. classless, moneyless and stateless. 

So, to compare a bit. Communism is a political doctrine that proposes that the workers assume control of the means of production, destroying the bourgeois state and privilege in the process.

I would say this makes the question of who we call a Nazi extremely relevant.

In addition, I'm using the word thought crime in as literal a sense as I can. This has nothing to do with 1984. This has to do with someone saying that someone should be killed because they think something. Which I guess has something to do with 1984, but it's not a parallel drawn because of it.

In addition, if you look at the context of the thread you'd notice that the entire time I've been talking about the people painted as Nazis because they're conservative or endorse things that others might consider suspect. 

Saying ""Nazis want to commit genocide"" is ignoring the context of the discussion in favour of a straw man you get to feel good about.

What an absurd bar to clear. There was nazi imagery, salutes and chants, and yet larger group of non-nazis didn't call it out?

Being complicit with Nazis may not make you a Nazi but it doesn't make you a whole lot better or do much to help the general image of others.

>Milo Yiannopoulos isn't a fascist, he's conservative.

Only to the untrained eye. One of the core features of fascism is nationalism. People like Milo attribute social problems not to structural oppression or the actions of the state but to the characteristics of people within social groups defined as outside the imagined community of the nation. Without blacks to blame for crime, Mexicans to blame for job losses, Jews to blame for the banking crisis, gays to blame for undermining the traditional family, SJWs to blame for a polarized political climate, and so on and so onâ€¦ we would actually have to look at capitalism, oppression, and state power to figure out why we have the problems we have today. Milo and others like him actively try to make people ignore those systemic issues and instead blame their problems and the problems of society on minorities.

>Pushing these people into tighter echo chambers will not persuade them out of their views. The Nazis do not need a large presence, people are being driven towards them by all the anti-white, anti-men rhetoric that is perpetuated all over the media now.

Resistance to fascism doesnâ€™t increase interest in fascist views. If anything, liberals mobilizing to defend fascists on free speech grounds increases interest in their views by conferring legitimacy on them. This plays directly into their organizing goals, allowing them to drive a wedge between their opponents using free speech as a smokescreen. By tolerating racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia, so-called free speech advocates are complicit in the acts of terror that fascist organizing makes possible.

If we used the same methods used in the Black Book to count the deaths caused by capitalism, we would come up with a similarily bloated number. 

Regardless, I think the difference between the systematic extermination of people, and a violent revolution in which many people are killed should be pretty obvious. Besides, many communists nowadays are revissionists that did learn from the terror and oppression that took place in the USSR and in Maoist China (this is why we have communist parties in bourgeois parliaments, something Marx, Engels and Lenin condemned strongly, as they thought that the only way to power is through revolution). Another difference is that, while nazism was fully implemented, communism has not ever been fully implemented. Never once has a stateless, classless, moneyless communist society existed in modern history.

> *by fairness we mean equality of outcome which means punishing people for doing well.

No. By justice they mean that every worker owns themself, and the means that they use to produce. This just means that nobody can get rich by exploiting other people, and they have to work instead.

There were plenty of enemies, not just fascists. They mainly killed bourgeois and ""enemies of the revolution"".

I mean, ignoring the sarcasm, this is not entirely untrue. Look at the Spanish Civil War, or Chile, or Nicaragua, or Argentina, or PerÃº...

You don't have a very good understanding of those who side with antifa. Leftists don't want to punish people for doing well. They work to address the root causes of the inequality of outcome that you are referring to, causes such as institutional racism and the inherently exploitative nature of capitalism.

>And thatâ€™s why another consistent feature of fascism is virulent opposition to communists, anarchists, and most other radicals. Why such a focus on fighting radicals and leftists? Well, in large part because theyâ€™ve been the most prominent militant anti-fascists since the beginning. And allying with powerful conservative forces against radicals can bring leverage and legitimacy to the extreme right wing. But fundamentally the reason for this opposition is because radicals also mobilize around discontent in society, but rather than offering false racist explanations and oppressive solutions, look at the root causes and promote solidarity among all people towards a freer world.

A good and topical example is racism; many people say they are against racism and think races are equal, and double-down on it when confronted. This is because the cultural attitudes in many developed countries demonize racism. However, only a subset of those people really understand *why* racism and prejudice is wrong. They are relatively immune to the specific packaging of Nazism as it existed in Germany or racism in the KKK, but readily offer support to people and movements who support the same things with different language.

To say that communists, socialists, and anarchists are ""as bad or worse than"" Nazis demonstrates your complete lack of understanding of those ideologies.

In general terms, those three ideologies aim for a free and classless society, and they do not inherently advocate for achieving that through violent means. Nazis ideology is inherently violent because it aims for creating an Aryan/white ethnostate, which can only be accomplished through genocide or other violent means.

Sure, there are many anarchists, socialists, and communists who believe that violent revolution will be needed to achieve their ideal society. However, the targets of that violence are the bourgeoisie, i.e. those whose livelihoods are built upon the backs and bodies of the working class. I myself do not advocate the murder of anyone or any class of people.

Here in Germany the far right (as right as you can get here without quoting Nazi phrases directly) has gained support but it's still politic as usual with more cuts to social services because the economy is still healthy. Politics has put the wellbeing of the economy before the wellbeing of the population.

2 things I want to note.

> Not surprisingly, beliefs about the 2016 election and voter fraud were correlated with support for postponement. People who believed that Trump won the popular vote, that there were millions of illegal votes in 2016, or that voter fraud is not rare were more likely to support postponing the election. This support was also more prevalent among Republicans who were younger, were less educated, had less factual knowledge of politics and strongly identified with the party.

This is incredibly disheartening but also exactly what I expect out of the base the Republicans have built. Blind party loyalty regardless of how much it would destroy the country.

But.

> Postponing the 2020 presidential election is not something that Trump or anyone in his administration has even hinted at, but for many in his constituency, floating such an idea may not be a step too far.

Have you watched the 1972 film [Cabaret](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068327/), or the musical on which it was based, set in 1931 Berlin? There's a memorable snippet of conversation in it that goes:

> ""The Nazis are just a gang of stupid hooligans, but they do serve a purpose. Let them get rid of the Communists. Later we'll be able to control them.""

> ""But who exactly is 'we'?""

> ""Germany, of course.""

Later on there's a very [ominous scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0E3m47pOE4) featuring the Hitler Youth. Listen to what one man says to the other at the end.

The idea that ""nobody acquiesced"" is nonsensical. Historian Alan Bullock wrote that â€œ[t]he Communists openly announced that they would prefer to see the Nazis in power rather than lift a finger to save the republicâ€. The Catholic Centre Party failed to recognize the threat and continued to negotiate with the Nazis to protect their own interests. And the German Right, much like the Republican Party of today, chose to try to partner with the popular fascist rather than denounce him and strip him of power. Hindenburg and Papen had been opposed to Hitler but ultimately succumbed to pressure and appointed him Chancellor in a misguided attempt to control him. Look how that turned out.

In fact the entire history of Hitler's rise is a story of myopia, negligence, and acquiescence. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power):

> Both within Germany and abroad initially there were few fears that Hitler could use his position to establish his later dictatorial single-party regime. Rather, the conservatives that helped to make him chancellor were convinced that they could control Hitler and ""tame"" the Nazi Party while setting the relevant impulses in the government themselves; foreign ambassadors played down worries by emphasizing that Hitler was ""mediocre"" if not a bad copy of Mussolini; even SPD politician Kurt Schumacher trivialized Hitler as a ""DekorationsstÃ¼ck"" (""piece of scenery/decoration"") of the new government. German newspapers wrote that, without doubt, the Hitler-led government would try to fight its political enemies (the left-wing parties), but that it would be impossible to establish a dictatorship in Germany because there was ""a barrier, over which violence cannot proceed"" and because of the German nation being proud of ""the freedom of speech and thought"".",2017-10-07 11:36:55,1,

Right... They're disinclined to governmentally enforce them, but:

It's hilarious that you have no concept of what ""left"" is or history at all. He literally despised communism/socialism (you know, because he literally rounded up and killed all the socialist/communist parties in Germany). 

To quote Hitler himself:

>""The great masses of workmen want nothing else than bread and amusement; they have no understanding of idealism; and we can never count on being able to gain any considerable support among them. **What we want is a picked number from the new ruling class, who â€“ unlike you â€“ are not troubled with humanitarian feelings**, but who are convinced that they have the right to rule as being a superior race, and who will secure and maintain their rule ruthlessly over the broad masses""

What he is saying is literally implementing a class system. A class based system is literally antithesis to the core tennants of Communism/Socialism - that all have a say in the community and that they will be provided for/treated according to their needs.

This is exactly this issue, and it's telling (albeit wholly unsurprising) that this sentiment is being buried in this thread.

It's very easy to dismiss this when you're a firmly left leaning person - as I can only assume the majority of this sub is - who can be 100% certain that they're not the ones being referred to.

But for those of us on the other side, it's a little less unclear. Are they referring to legitimate, honest-to-god, armband-wearing *Nazis*, or are they using ""Nazi"" in the more expansive sense? I'm not surprised that to left-leaning people the answer is obviously the former because I'm assuming most left leaning people have never been sincerely accused of being a Nazi.

However, many of us on the right *have* been accused of being Nazis, even those of us (like myself) who hold *zero fascistic views*.

And so while it's easy for those on the left to handwave this away as nothing, those of us on the right have legitimate cause to wonder if this is a dogwhistle way of referring to garden variety conservatives as Nazis as well. Maybe that sounds alarmist, but the video game industry is notably left-leaning and it's *never* been easier for a non-fascist to be accused of being a Nazi than it is right now.

At the *bare minimum*, I'd argue the developers are capitalizing on all the ""punch a Nazi"" sentiment that's been going around. While I don't think there's anything wrong with that, the fact that ""punch a Nazi"" in many circles effectively means ""punch a conservative"" makes me think twice about this when I wouldn't otherwise.

Overall I'm willing to give the devs the benefit of the doubt, but I absolutely understand how normal, not-Nazi people could see this ad campaign and be thinking in the back of their minds: ""*They're not talking about me, are they?...*""

**In a more rational age this wouldn't be controversial, but unfortunately we do not live in rational times with rational people, so ""punch a Nazi"" doesn't always just mean ""punch a Nazi"".**

Hopefully this lends a new perspective to the situation and some people wondering how in the hell anyone has a problem with this ad campaign have some sort of an answer besides ""Nazis are mad"" because it's more complicated than that these days.",2017-10-06 20:40:12,15,

2406,328.0,killbot0224,"Sure.

Your post is basically one big gaslight. 

Trump has basically made sowing division a strategy, for one. Bannon has stated that it *explicitly*.

The *actual* Nazis were not left wing. They weren't socialists. They used the word in their name for marketing, basically.

""Nazis/fascists had the media in their palm""

Yeah the ""left"" tilt of the modern media is not because the ""left have the media in their palm""

There is no government control of the media. The media is independent, and leans left largely because greater education and exposure lead to greater empathy, and right wing ideals (every man for themselves + social conservatismt + hard line law and order) run counter to that empathy. 

If you work in media, travel the world, read about the whole world, and know about how successful socialist programs actually are then it becomes hard to not want to push for more in America... Oh wait. Social security is already here (and is THE golden hands off program)  

One of the big scams of the right in America isn't just to prevent socialist programs from being started, but to sabotage any that are so they can say ""see? This doesn't work!"" 

Meanwhile Hitler's health care wasn't for everyone... It was for the whites. 

Jews got really fuckin lousy healthcare. 

Belief in collectivism is not a ""nazi ideal"" that somehow you must run away from. 

The real joke is that you just called liberalism a ""narrow ideology"" though. 

What's narrow about empathy, inclusiveness, collectivism, and social acceptance? 

Narrowness is disenfranchising voters, preaching intolerance against (take your pick), encouraging police to violently violate suspects' right. 

Being intolerant of the intolerant is not ""narrow"" 

Remember the last time people were ""tolerant"" of Nazis?

The National Fascist Party (Partito Nazionale Fascista, PNF) was an Italian political party, created by Benito Mussolini as the political expression of fascism (previously represented by groups known as Fasci). The party ruled Italy from 1922 when Fascists took power with the March on Rome, to 1943, when Mussolini was deposed by the Grand Council of Fascism.

Preceding the PNF, Mussolini's first established political party was known as the ""Fascist Revolutionary Party"" (Partito Fascista Rivoluzionario, PFR), which was, according to Mussolini, founded in 1915. After poor November 1919 election results, the PFR was eventually renamed the National Fascist Party during the Third Fascist Congress in Rome on November 7-10, 1921.

The Night of the Long Knives (German:  Nacht der langen Messer ), also called Operation Hummingbird (German: Unternehmen Kolibri) or, in Germany, the RÃ¶hm Putsch (German spelling: RÃ¶hm-Putsch), was a purge that took place in Nazi Germany from June 30 to July 2, 1934, when the Nazi regime carried out a series of political extrajudicial executions intended to consolidate Hitler's absolute hold on power in Germany. Many of those killed were leaders of the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazis' own paramilitary organization, colloquially known as the ""Brownshirts"" due to the color of their uniforms. The best-known victim of the purge was Ernst RÃ¶hm, the SA's leader and one of Hitler's longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the left-wing Strasserist faction of the Nazi Party (NSDAP), along with its figurehead, Gregor Strasser, were also killed, as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis, such as former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and Bavarian politician Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who had suppressed Adolf Hitler's Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923.

Trump's a proto-fascist, Clinton's a neo-liberal that only wants to make the rich richer.

Well, Trump has a long history of racism. His dad was caught at a Klan rally in the '30s, implying there's a history in the family. In the '70s, he was sued for housing discrimination against black people. There's the ad he took out against the Central Park Five, and how he stood by what he said even after they were proven innocent.

I don't think Trump supporters explicitly support fascism. I don't think you guys all sleep with a copy of *Mein Kampf* under your pillows or anything. Fascism, though, is particular to the country it arises in.

The foundation is there. Over the past ten years or so, many, many people have begun to call out instances of sexism and racism in American society.

If you need to ask this question, we're already in trouble.

He takes all his trips to his own properties... where he charges the feds for accomodations.

He *openly promotes* his golf course, his hotels, etc from the podium.

He places greater importance on retaliating against criticism than on doing right (Puerto Rico)

He continually seeks to score cheap points with his base through twitter rants and insults rather than lead the country. (Rocket Man? Is it *trying* to antagonize NK?) HIs self-congratulation is endless.

Right Wing? John McCain if he thinks Trump upholds Right wing values?

> The man has done more in his first year than Osamba did in his first term.

What are his accomplishments exactly?

He has Congress, Senate *and* the Supreme Court... and they can't get a repeal of the ACA through. Took 3 tries to get a largely cosmetic ""travel ban"" through?

> Neo-Nazis don't even like him, so that's false. Again.

A joke of the highest level. 

David Duke, for one, openly encouraged his followers to support support Trump. That's how highly he thinks of him. Neo Nazis have been emboldened by his very existence, feeling *validated* by him. Richard Spencer (an open white supremacist) loves that Trump is in the big seat.

> He's not an opportunist

Except... he is. You don't have to watch long, or read much about his past to know it.

His MO has always been to do whatever he could get away with (his real estate career was founded on it), and he has an enormous ego. He wants to be president largely for the sake of being able to say he's president. He has no coherent ideology, but could only have made it as a republican, so he ran as a republican.

As for Tim Allen losing his show... Did I say the media didn't lean left? No, I didn't say that. I absolutely agree that the media leans right.

But you promoted an outright false equivalency of a *leftist* media compared to a government controlled media. That's an out-and-out lie.

As for Last Man Standing... it was popular but not a blockbuster. Its politics may not have helped, but it was hardly a shoe-in, especially when pay raises are expected around 6 seasons and ABC didn't own it

If ABC owned it, it may have continued. And if it was so great (and had a strong business case) then I'm sure they could have shopped it around and jumped networks.

> They have first amendment rights just like everybody else, though

They do. That's why the *government* doesn't stifle those rights. Counter-protesters aren't stifling free speech though.

BTW... actively encouraging owners of NFL teams to FIRE players who protest the national Anthem is *actively spitting in the face of the 1st Amendment.*

That is using the power of the executive to attempt to stifle free speech.

Your entire post can be summed up as being a bad orator.

The leftoid legacy media (LLM) will never report fairly on Trumpâ€™s good deeds and bigly heart.

Iâ€™ll assume you reading have seen the YT video of PRESIDENT TRUMPâ€™S live press conference, in which he perforated the usual suspects â€” rogue Derp Staters and the defanged and deteriorated shitlib media â€” with a rhetorical howitzer aimed calmly and even humorously at his targets.

As great as that Trump appearance could be fairly judged, there was an even better, and more important, video of him shot on the same day.

That appearance was Trumpâ€™s signing ceremony with WV coal miners, keeping his promise to roll back a burdensome and redundant Osamba regulation. It was an emotionally reverberating reminder of Trumpâ€™s big heart and why Heritage America loves him as their own.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAvbPPf-NPI

Trump has a genuine and sincere common manâ€™s touch. He may be a billionaire playboy President, but his heart is good olâ€™ boy and his soul salt of the earth. Heâ€™s a manâ€™s man and a ladyâ€™s man without the hoverhand, a Vince McMahon-schooled showman and now the true leader of a revolution we may not deserve, but need more than ever. PBUT.

On the subject of Trumpâ€™s speaking style:

My thoughts on Trump the extemporaneous speaker: Not a master rhetorician. Leaves killer points on the table too often. Can veer off on tangents.
And none of that matters. Why? Because the man has balls. BIG FUCKING BALLS THE SIZE OF BOULDERS. Thatâ€™s all it takes. All itâ€™s ever taken. Balls.
And one more thingâ€¦.candor. Balls & candor. The two are often seen together.

Friend objects,

Your wisdom is showing! Yet, as I agree with most of what you say, I must add that Trump is a master of one-liners, a RETORTICIAN if not a rhetorician as when I heard him say â€œlow-life leakersâ€ I burst out with laughter and enjoy his refreshing CANDOR.
Friend is absolutely right. My complaints about Trumpâ€™s speaking style were in fact â€œbackhanded insultsâ€, meaning they were really praise. Trumpâ€™s lack of polish is his great strength; heâ€™s candid, earthy, and funny, and that resonates with Americans even if it bugs snobby, conniving Acela elites. â€œRetorticianâ€. I like it.

The moment you started blabbering about Stalin's statue, I knew exactly what statue you meant because there was a report about it. And it's more than likely the only Lenin statue in the US.

Basically, a bunch of right wingers staged a protest because of that very statue and there were about half a dozen morons parading around it holding signs and chanting slogans.

Well, the problem was that they didn't actually know how the statue had gotten there, because they hadn't bothered to do their research.

One imported Lenin statue in United States is a non-issue.

Obama isn't calling Trump names either. Trump did question Obama's citizenship. 

> Left invented this stolen election and collusion thing based on foreighn intelligence whose sources are paid Russians

Most people aren't claiming that election was stolen. Most are saying that Russia tried to influence the election and that they were partially successful. That's why it's of paramount importance that the matter is investigated and safeguards are put in place so that it wouldn't happen again.

And it doesn't happen just in the United States - Russia has also tried to meddle into elections in Europe. For instance Russian hackers infiltrated Emmanuel Macron's email just before French presidential election.

Obama did provide proof but nothing was enough for the conspiracy theorists, including Trump.

There is plenty of evidence of Russia's actions both in the United States and in Europe. Do you think American and European intelligence agencies are wrong?

Divide and conquer - that's what Putin is doing. Conquering isn't even necessary. Russians are beating United States and Europe in cyber warfare 6-0. Russia itself is much more resilient to information warfare because there's no free press to speak of.

Trump is still refusing to release his tax returns. What is he hiding? And Jared Kushner has been using private email as well when conducting government business. Oops.

I didn't refute your argument. You claimed that Trump's actions are presidential because he is the president. The logical conclusion is that every president's actions are presidential because they are presidents. I'm following your logic. If you don't like where your logic leads, maybe you should rethink your positions.

Since the start of Cold War untill even today both Russia and US have propaganda in each others countries or borders. So this is nothing new, we do it to them they do it to us. However whole thing you said doesn't answer to what I was talking and that is Witch hunt about Collusion. There's proof in itself that DNC refuses FBI access to hacked servers that they are hiding something, and no one is investigating that.

No one is asking why Russia became more aggressive, but do remember of Russians expelling USAID and calling Hillary out for trying to overthrow them. Then Obama and EU trying to overthrow their allies, maybe this triggered them of being pushed in the corner?
I'm just being a realist here and I supported Obama, but not his encroching on Russia as I knew eventually they would retaliate.

Ok if Obama provided proof then that discredited Trumps claims and that's it.


Sure there's evidence of Russian CITIZENS doing hacking, but none about collusion. You remember anyone who as much as shook hands with Russians at some dinner was accused of collusion. 

The moment I stopped listening to CNN was when they kept pushing that ""Russians hacked our election"" trying to portray it as if they changed votes in voting machines. So free press should be held accountable of dissinformation.


I can tell you what Trump is hiding with his taxes, he's not worth anywhere near to what he says, he's also not claiming to be a victim of something and not allowing investigators to look at it.

Maybe because it was taken down in its country of origin. And after it was taken down, an American bought it and shipped to US. Context matters. It wasn't erected by local officials - it just ended up in Seattle.

Czechoslovakians took it down - I've tried to repeatedly hone that point in but you and your friend just don't get it.

Let me put it this way - if some of those confederate statues ended up in eastern Europe after Americans took them down nobody would care. There's no context or history with confederacy in eastern europe.

We are talking about one specific Lenin statue that was imported to United states. You are trying to draw equivalence between that specific statue and confederate statues. There isn't any.

I already mentioned that people in the former Soviet Union states want those statues gone and that is what happened to the Lenin statue - it was teared down in Czechoslovakia because people saw it as a symbol of oppression. Even though it's part of their history, they don't want to be constantly reminded about Soviet Union.

After an American bought the statue and shipped it to US, it no longer has that same context - it's owned by private citizen and it's in private property. It's not there to remind people that they were once part of Soviet Union because that is not part of their history. And literally no one gives a shit what happens to that statue.

End of confederacy didn't mean end of oppression. Segregation ended in the 1960s. Those statues symbolize Jim Crow era and that's much more recent than the civil war itself.

I mentioned how in Eastern Europe on the former Soviet Union States, people want to tear down and have tore down statues of Lenin et al. And that's understandable because to those people Lenin represents oppression. People who oppose are mostly Russians on both Russia and Russians who still live in those countries.

If you agree that those people have a right to demand those statues removed, I have a hard time understanding why confederate statues couldn't be viewed the same way - as a relic of oppression. Put some statues in museum and teach people what happened in Civil War and after.

There's no comparison to pyramids. There's no artistic or architectural value in those statues as opposed to pyramids. And as others have pointed out, current research is challenging the view that slaves build pyramids.

Russia gives money to far-right movements across Europe and world. Russian hackers compromised Emmanuel Macron's email account right at the eve of French election and added false information and then made everything public. They were trying to help Marine Le Pen to win the election. Russians also tried to influence Brexit vote.

Russia is a direct threat to Western democracies and tries to undermine our election process and trust in the system. But since Trump takes everything related to Russia personally, he doesn't take the threat seriously.

Weighty issues of political philosophy. Genuinely probing questions about the conflict between various ideals and the relationships between them. 

Not petty, presentist partisanship.

Vampire: Bloodlines was political. The entire game was about a conflict between political factions and each faction had its own take on the ideal political order *for vampires* given the facts regarding vampire nature. That is political. That is substance.

BioShock and BioShock 2 criticized utopianism and argued that human nature is messy and complicated and prone to hypocrisy and opportunism and the lust for power. This makes a ""perfect world"" effectively impossible, or at least easily destroyed if just one thing goes wrong. That is political. That is a weighty issue in political philosophy. 

Transgender pronouns, transgender bathrooms, manspreading, media representation, online harassment, spelling mistakes in Presidential tweets, that's all trivial bullshit with no political substance or universal appeal. Its craven, stupid, shallow and so utterly small minded... It takes one geographically specific, chronologically specific, tiny issue and treats it like a sacred principle in political culture. Its politics *for parochial morons who can't see that they're in a tiny bubble*. Its the most fucking solipsistic shit.

To my understanding were some attempts at cooperation between American Nazis and KKK members early on, but the groups were very distrustful of one another and nothing much came of it. The KKK tends to be very xenophobic, and I doubt many of them would ever support a foreign invasion of their homeland, regardless of the color and racial ideologies of the invaders. Plus, while they were certainly nationalists, I don't know that they would buy into fascism like that. Whether we like to admit it or not, they seem rooted in individualist American values, and I don't see them toeing the party line, especially from foreigners.

One of the reasons fascism doesn't spread like communism does, is that it is heavily based on nationalism. It's hard to convince people to adopt your philosophy of in-group vs. out-group subservience to the state when your rise to power was based on characterizing them as the out-group. Especially so when they're already nationalists, and thus have their own in-group. For the Nazis to get real support from the KKK, they'd really have to make an effort to target them as a group, and make concessions for their ideals. This wasn't going to happen, since the KKK was already rapidly spiraling into irrelevance.


Of course, I wouldn't put it past occupation forces to co-opt a group, put collaborators in charge, and purge all the dissenters, so that the organization has the same face but is a puppet for the regime. But again the question would be why. By the 40s, the KKK was neither influential nor popular with the American people.

But as others mentioned, Nazis weren't super consistent with their values. Their values were honestly whatever supported the party that day. They talked a lot of Aryan-this and eugenics-that, but most of their allies were on their racial shit-list and most of their enemies among the western allied forces were on their approved list. They stuck to their ideologies when it was convenient, and abandoned them at a moment's notice when it wasn't.

I realize ""Trump voters are all Nazis"" is a popular idea in certain communities, but that doesn't make it true. I'm not saying that Bethesda was actually trying to make that statement, but it could easily come across that way for a Trump voter.

And yes, I'm sure that actual Nazis don't like this game either, but the bulk of the complaints are coming from people that feel like Trump voters are being equated with Nazis.

2935,16.0,electrotherobot,"I was thinking about this exact subject earlier today, but the truth is it's not complicated.

People aren't upset by the idea of killing 'Nazis', as we picture Nazis in WW2. It's just that the term 'Nazi', much like 'racist', 'bigot', 'misogynist', etc. have been so diluted at this point that people aren't sure what they mean anymore.

I mean, I think the vast majority of us can agree that killing Hitler is fun. But there are a lot of very vocal and influential people these days who *actually* seem to believe that, say, the president of the United States is a Nazi. Or that pretty much anyone who holds conservative views with regards to immigration or racial issues is also a Nazi.

I mean, I recently got branded a 'Nazi apologist' by a bunch of angry liberals simply because I suggested that sucker punching Richard Spencer in the head was not actually the right thing to do.

I have to say that, though my political leanings on social issues have traditionally been more leftist, the political left in 2017 is dangerously eroding the meaning of some very serious terms in an apparent attempt to justify violence and open hostility against anyone they disagree with.

It's really an icky situation, but it has led to people being uncomfortable with stuff like this Wolfenstein promotional material, because there's an increasing chance that the people they're marketing this game toward have, themselves been told that they're Nazis.",2017-10-07 00:58:08,53,

What people are taking issue with is comparing how people should react to the modern neo-nazi movement with how people should react to the fucking third reich.

What people don't like is jackasses making obnoxious comments saying that if you disagree with the trend of punching ""nazis"" then you also disagree with the violence in wolfenstein.

The game is about a military occupation of America by the original nazis. Comparing that to modern neo-nazis, a group which has always been weak and ineffectual, is asinine.

You're not making some edgy political statement by jerking off about how much you love killing nazis in a fucking video game.

Oh. Yeah. Wonder why he would ever want to direct media attention towards a game being sold by Bethesda. I guess it's just *too controversial* for him to not speak up. What a brave boy.

I suppose it's possible that Hines might be having a stroke? He's confused and thinks this is the *original* Wolfenstein and he's talking about violence in video games as a new concept?

Also, it's something that gets said a lot, but *holy shit* Americans really do enjoy some hardcore revisionism, don't they?

You don't really get to claim that fighting Nazis is a core part of your cultural identity when your nation was content to supply and sell to those Nazis for years before joining the war. The USSR, too - Truman was quoted as effectively saying that he was specifically aiming to prolong the war and make sure as many Russians killed Germans as Germans killed Russians.

How do you think the US so quickly rose to power after World War 2? You'd been racking up debts and leases from anyone who wanted to fuel a tank and march an army - or, I guess, any *other* reasons the Nazis might have had to start big fires with so much fuel - and you'd already started collecting, with interest, by the end of the war.

When they say something like ""Make America Nazi-Free Again"" it can be interpreted literally in the context of the game - liberating America from a foreign Nazi regime - and take the MAGA reference as a joke.

Another way to interpret this as a call to action against what the likes of AntiFA consider to be a Nazi - everyone to the right of them - and the MAGA reference as a reference to Trump, and an insinuation that he's one of those ""nazis"" they're referring to.

The difference between the two is very significant. The first one is a fictional scenario and the second one is a call to ideological cleansing. Murdering other Americans because of their ideology is profoundly un-american and goes against fundamental American values.

They probably had the first version in mind, but I hope you can see how some people might look at it and think of the latter interpretation.

It's the alt right defining the conservative ideology and thus convincing normal conservatives that it's bad to kill Nazis in a video game.

What's happening here is conservatives have bought into alt right (Nazi) rhetoric about liberals being ideological, tribal, enemies who call everyone Nazis.

So they make the connection that ""They call us Nazis, they want to kill Nazis, therefore they want to kill us"".

Conservatives have to confront the alt right because as I said, the alt right is becoming the new face of the republican party.

1) They argue that there is a tendency for liberals to (unfairly) conflate certain right-wing movements with fringe nazi movements. Right -> Alt-right -> white nationalism -> white supremecy -> nazi. There is a chain of association and name calling.

2) there is strong core belief that everyone should be free from violent action and have equal rights, no matter how vile their viewpoint is (going against the ""punch a nazi"" thing). I would say that the ACLU probably sides with the constitutional conservatives on this point.

They want to stick to their beliefs without being labelled as siding with nazis, but that doesn't happen. They see things like the ""Make America Anti-Nazi Again"" and it puts them on edge because, this is exactly the problem that they see with liberals, conflating their trump support as being a nazi.

Some of this is from memory so it's not perfect - but during the campaign Hillary tried to ""flip"" Trumps campaign slogan by implying ""Ameirca is already great"".  The general attempt fell flat and was largely forgotten.

This issue currently is the phrasing and what we can imply through political rehtoric.

Lets take the two messages ""Make America Great Again"" and ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" (the slogan in the game marketing).

Well if we take these two messages side by side - first and foremost - one is absolutely cribbed from the other - there is no disputing this.  And secondly, side by side, it adopts the same sort of ""stance"" as what Hillary's campaign attempted during 2016.  Imply making america great (again) was redundant.

If viewed from this framing it puts ""make America America again"" as the opposing stance against the message it's cribbing from - a ""correction"" much like what the Hillary Campaign tired.   If that's the case then the message ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" is challenging would place it by default on the ""other side"" - in this case ""The Nazi side"".

They were disenfranchised Germans who were attempting to find a new sense of pride and power in the world. And they used that to commit genocide.

Those who feel disenfranchised are often drawn to such groups. But here's a couple other issues with your characterization.

One is that these groups are not meek. There is nothing meek about them. They protest, they take over public forums (both online and IRL) and they do act on their message of hatred with violence.

Two is a consideration of their actual power. They are disenfranchised in the sense that they are typically poor and uneducated, but are also young white men. The odd thing is that they're disenfranchised because of the former, but its the areas in which they are already dominate that they attribute the disenfranchisement to. Instead of attributing their poverty, joblessness, etc to issues like lack of education, discrimination based on legal past (how many ex-cons wear swastikas?), etc, they attribute it to their race and gender - the two areas in which they have a huge leg up in the world because of. So while they are among the disenfranchised in our society, they completely misattribute that and, instead of working to actually help themselves, only further victimize other disenfranchised groups. Because of this, I do not give them a pass.

If they were like so many Americans who falsely attribute issues in our country to immigrants or ""political correctness"" - if they were merely wrong, I could understand. But they aren't. They are loud and they are violent. And their vocal minority only validates those views in the minds of others who feel that same disenfranchisement. They are a violent group. They align themselves with those who number among the most hateful and awful organizations in history. And they do so knowingly. They do not get a pass. It doesn't mean I don't understand - I do. But I do not forgive, excuse or in any way cut them slack.

I feel very strongly that while we should understand what causes such groups, and while we should try to solve the root problems, we should be very clear, very adamant, very *unwavering* in our disavowal of their actions and theories. It's important that we do not contribute to their rhetoric, that we do not, in any way,  give the impression that we agree with it. That's part of what makes this so difficult: they have turned to such rhetoric because they are not being heard, but we cannot allow their voice to dominate the conversation and further victimize other disenfranchised groups.",2017-10-07 03:11:07,18,

The reality is likely that the statement isn't controversial at all, but the prospect of it being controversial is in itself controversial.

If...that makes any sense?

Trump actually does this masterfully (intentionally or not is a different matter).  You can make relatively neutral statements until you're blue, and people will normally ignore them.  But all you have to do is insinuate that the statement you're making is somehow defied by a party (any party, but particularly one that isn't yours), and suddenly there's hundreds of people up in arms about who could possibly disagree with such a statement.  It works surprisingly well, and you can say the most mundane shit too, but as soon as you insinuate that there's a disagreement, you have people rally to your side.

""I've heard conversations. There's people, and I'm sure some of them are smart people, saying that the sky isn't blue.  Now, I don't know about you, but that sky certainly looks blue to me.  Does it look blue to you? I know you know it's blue, and I know it's blue, but there are some people that don't seem to think that way.""

Boom. Suddenly everyone is pointing fingers.  ""Who are these ""smart people"" on Side B that don't think that the sky is blue?  This just goes to emphasize <stereotype>.  We smart people on Side A know what's up.  Blue sky, that's what.  We can't have people doing <job> that think something so stupid that the sky isn't blue!""  Meanwhile of course there's no way of proving or disproving what was overheard, or who said it, or why.  You solidify your position because no sane person is going to prattle on about how the sky isn't blue.  Flawless victory, and you haven't even said anything important.  Side B is reeling and sputtering on the defensive trying to fend off accusations of corrupting our youth by teaching them that the sky is a different color than blue, completely unable to form a statement of their own as everyone rolls their eyes going ""OK, sure you didn't say anything about the sky, we believe you"".

As far as Jon Tron, he is half Iranian so not exactly an ally of actual Nazis.  He also made the mistake of debating Destiny who was infinitely more experienced and prepared and was able to easily manipulate him into saying those dumb things. Destiny even said it himself that he gave Jon just enough rope to hang himself with.

Some of this is from memory so it's not perfect - but during the campaign Hillary tried to ""flip"" Trumps campaign slogan by implying ""Ameirca is already great"".  The general attempt fell flat and was largely forgotten.

This issue currently is the phrasing and what we can imply through political rehtoric.

Lets take the two messages ""Make America Great Again"" and ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" (the slogan in the game marketing).

Well if we take these two messages side by side - first and foremost - one is absolutely cribbed from the other - there is no disputing this.  And secondly, side by side, it adopts the same sort of ""stance"" as what Hillary's campaign attempted during 2016.  Imply making america great (again) was redundant.

If viewed from this framing it puts ""make America America again"" as the opposing stance against the message it's cribbing from - a ""correction"" much like what the Hillary Campaign tired.   If that's the case then the message ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" is challenging would place it by default on the ""other side"" - in this case ""The Nazi side"".

There is more to it than just the above but the above is a good general framing as to why it's disingenuous to write-off conservatives being upset about this as them de-facto trying to defend Nazis.   Conservative offense in this case, at least from what I can see - isn't being taken because people are attacking Nazis - it's because people are attacking conservatives being lumped in via campaign slogan cribbing *with* Nazis - when for over the last year they've been painted as Nazis 24/7 by their political opponents.

In 2017, it's not generally acceptable to be a racist except in your own little racist subculture. They are at the bottom of the social order, and their status at the bottom is not in question. Because it's not in question and there is no legitimate conflict, there is no dialogue necessary. They are irrelevant. They should be belittled and mocked to discourage people from seeing those views as a reasonable thing to hold.

By opening a dialogue you bring into question their status at the bottom of the social order. ""Surely if they have a voice then they're worth listening to?"" - it legitimates their goal of upsetting the order.

Ads are one of the few ways to engage in a large swath of people without using language these people understand. Not only is it a way of getting into someone's mind, but stay there and permeate a thought space made exclusive for whatever the ad is for. That in itself is usually never bad until you enter Co-opting. In which case, the very idea of any hot button issue becomes boiled down to a way to get something across, which ends up being a moral problem and/or reduces that  issue to the butt of a joke. Or, in this case, turns the real and hot political division plaguing the USA into a way to remind people of a game involving an entirely different version of the country.

The examples I listed (which everyone fell for, again) should kept in mind regarding that. Dante's Inferno's advertising had a 'sin to win' contest inviting people to do whatever sinful acts they could think of to win some tat, AND this bait was revealed in a way that would get as much press and attention as possible. Likewise, the publisher behind such (EA, of course) didn't pull up on te reigns when it came to using other issues as footstools rather than platforms (LGBT rights, police brutality, etc).

All that sounds rather insane, right? Well, the worst of it is we don't really, and can't really, stop that if the campaign is successful since people fall into the mob mentality rather easily. We can prevent the damage from being largescale (and this is gaming, the scales don't get that large anyway), and this kind of crap doesn't really work over time...still.

4191,1272.0,maxis2k,">How does one make an anti-Nazi game(in which you brutally murder them by the thousands) and not wittingly or unwittingly tap into â€œliberalâ€ anger?

Both liberals and conservatives can hate Nazis.  This is probably why some people are getting mad.  This idea that liberals have cornered the market of hating Fascism.  Which leads to some extreme liberals using the brand Nazi or racism against anyone who doesn't follow their specific views.  [Like how a random guy on twitter accused Mike Rowe of being a nazi sympathizer simply because he didn't make a political comment about charlottesville.](http://mikerowe.com/2017/08/otw-the-overarching-logical-fallacies/)  Yet Mike Rowe also didn't make any comment defending or promoting Nazi's either.  He didn't make ANY comment.  Yet by being neutral, someone attacked him and claimed he was a nazi.  This is where things get dangerous.  You can argue we are losing free speech when people demand you have to make a statement about everything.  And then they label you as a nazi or racist if your view doesn't line up to theirs.  Even if your view doesn't support even mention nazi's in any way.

This mindset also leaks into media.  Various movies and video games have been putting political messages into games.  Because the last incarnation of the game got ripped on social media for not point out the social injustice of [x] historical figure.  So the next game, they start putting in a lot of political views about Karl Marx or Thomas Jefferson or whoever social media complained about last time.  But then those political messages anger others.  And you have a spiraling cycle where you anger one side by trying to appeal to the other.  All of which could have been avoided if they just didn't add politics into it in the first place.

But in the case of this game, you can't really avoid a political message.  So its pretty obvious they went all in and created a controversy to get a lot of free publicity.  And just look at the thousands of responses we're seeing today?  It worked.",2017-10-07 01:30:11,7,

4378,1459.0,Hamakua,"Not the person you replied to but I'd like to share a perspective and what I think is going on and where all the outrage is coming from.

Some of this is from memory so it's not perfect - but during the campaign Hillary tried to ""flip"" Trumps campaign slogan by implying ""Ameirca is already great"".  The general attempt fell flat and was largely forgotten.

This issue currently is the phrasing and what we can imply through political rehtoric.

Lets take the two messages ""Make America Great Again"" and ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" (the slogan in the game marketing).

Well if we take these two messages side by side - first and foremost - one is absolutely cribbed from the other - there is no disputing this.  And secondly, side by side, it adopts the same sort of ""stance"" as what Hillary's campaign attempted during 2016.  Imply making america great (again) was redundant.

If viewed from this framing it puts ""make America America again"" as the opposing stance against the message it's cribbing from - a ""correction"" much like what the Hillary Campaign tired.   If that's the case then the message ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" is challenging would place it by default on the ""other side"" - in this case ""The Nazi side"".

There is more to it than just the above but the above is a good general framing as to why it's disingenuous to write-off conservatives being upset about this as them de-facto trying to defend Nazis.   Conservative offense in this case, at least from what I can see - isn't being taken because people are attacking Nazis - it's because people are attacking conservatives being lumped in via campaign slogan cribbing *with* Nazis - when for over the last year they've been painted as Nazis 24/7 by their political opponents.

It was a bunch of lost white kids after a major recession who felt that their cultural identity was being threatened by immigrants. Nazism was specifically about restoring Germany to its former glory through racial nationalism, a return to ""traditional"" German values, and the rejection of ""invaders"" from other countries - such as the Jews and the gypsys. Hence notions like ""the blood and the soil"" (calling for a white European ethnostate), or Kulturbolschewismus (a rejection of aesthetic or academic creations that challenge traditional values). 

On a side note, the hatred of Jewish peoples was not original to Hitler or the Nazis, but historic in Germany. Hitler just mobilized it into a political tool.

Even ignoring that the REAL American Nazis - Richard Spencer and his crew over at Alternative Right, who are literally calling for a white ethnostate founded on ""traditional"" American values - it's pretty damn scary that we now have a campaign that ran on the tail end of a recession, focused on ""Making America Great Again"", ""traditional"" values, rejecting ""invaders"" from other countries. Meanwhile, their supporters are marching with literal ""blood and soil"" signs, calling for genocide (to ""glass"" Muslim nations), rejecting aesthetic or academic work that challenges traditional values, and even a twisted rebirth of ""bolshevik"" as a snarl word - this time as ""marxism"". 

There's not really a difference here, and it's terrifying that it's becoming mainstream.

PS. The hatred of Jews was actually pretty historic in Germany by the time that Hitler came around. Even the ""Jewish friendly"" leaders had an attitude of ""we won't kill you, but we will repress you!

Also: MAKE PRUSSIA GREAT AGAIN.

Nazi/white-supremacist groups began instructing their members to join the military or police, accumulate as much training as possible on guns and explosives, recruit when you can and keep contacts for future use. In 2009, DHS requested, as a response to this disturbing trend, funds and resources to combat the issue and ensure that our security forces aren't compromised by terrorists on our own soil. Their request was rejected, by conservatives like one of my dumbass senators John Cornyn.

""That all citizens of Porto Rico, as defined by section seven of the Act of April twelfth, nineteen hundred, ""temporarily to provide revenues and a civil government for Porto Rico, and for other purposes,"" and all natives of Porto Rico who were temporarily absent from that island on April eleventh, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, and have since returned and are permanently residing in that island, and are not citizens of any foreign country, are hereby declared, and shall be deemed and held to be, citizens of the United States: *Provided*, That any person hereinbefore described may retain his present political status by making a declaration, under oath, of his decision to do so within six months of the taking effect of this Act before the district court in the district in which he resides, the declaration to be in form as follows...""

You are pretending at an understanding of the law and of United States history that you simply do not possess, and it's making you look really, really silly. I'm willing to bet I would be horrified by all of the other things you've convinced yourself you understand.

Puerto Ricans are citizens, and are possessed of all the same rights guaranteed all other citizens of the United States by virtue of their citizenship.

Then there is the new wave of conservative voters Trump attracted.  The media kept calling them the alt-right to confuse people with the actual alt-right.  By naming the alt-right they can call Trump's supporters racist as much as they want without merit.

Trump base being what it is, saw the media wasn't stopping and took the term and ran with it.  Just like they did with deplorables.

Well good job, because you are one of the reasons it is spreading so much.

Nazism and its ilk (white nationalism/supremacy) don't deserve an open dialogue because this legitimizes them. For every person you might convert or dissuade through an open dialogue, there's ten more who see the Nazis as legitimate because you had to spend precious time and resources debating it as though it was an actual opinion.

This is a big problem with the American left: we think these battles can be won through information, fact, and reason. They can't, because these viewpoints are anathema to those principles to begin with and won't be persuaded by them. All debate does is elevate the opposing side. We made this mistake with climate change: rather than dismiss the deniers outright, we tried to debate them.

The reason this failed is because when people tend to see two sides of an issue debating, it gives the sense that both sides have some legitimacy and that either one is a valid choice. That's what we are conditioned too believe, with presidential ""debates"" where one candidate's opinions and feelings are just as valid as another candidate's facts.

I know it feels like the right thing to do but we learned the last time that open dialogue doesn't work on groups of people who don't desire it. There was no ""dialogue"" to be had with the Nazis back in '33, '36, or '39 because Hitler and the Nazis *weren't looking for diplomatic solutions*. Hitler himself admitted that if the KPD and the SPD had been able to recognize the Nazis for the threat that they were and suppress them (violently even), he would never have been able to seize power. These are people whose core ideology is based around achieving insane and violent principles, so trying to persuade them with facts and understanding will get nowhere because they don't want understanding and their opinions aren't based on fact.

You can reason with some racists, but I firmly believe anyone who is far-right enough to be full on Nazi or ""white nationalist"" (which is just a dolled-up term for Nazism, really) is beyond negotiating with. Some people are racist just because of bad experiences or being misguided, but it takes an actually malicious person to be a firm believe in the aforementioned ideologies.",2017-10-07 07:27:26,5,

Whether they were taught by their parents or had a bad experience that pushed them in that direction or simply are falling back on habit and ignorance, almost every single racist has a reason for their racism.  And outside of that racism, they are just regular people who are trying to live their lives the best way they know how.

It's like how for a while you got white supremacists using terms like 'race realism' and the like before that became an obvious front for racist views.

Assuming you're being genuine here and you're just a conservative who has picked those terms up because a certain segment of political right associated with white supremacist groups uses that as their main tactic, taking otherwise innocuous sounding terms and using them to hide hate speech so that when someone on the left points it out they can retort with 'silly liberals, you can't say anything these days without being called a nazi!' So what ends up happening is people on the left who aren't aware of this tactic attack centrist or moderate conservatives who just use the terms not realising their associations b/c they saw it on twitter or reddit etc, and then those leftists end up looking like nutcases who are attacking you for apparently no reason. Another good example of this is when Richard Spencer and some other dinguses started putting frogs in their twitter names, and the whole pepe/kekistan thing being a banner of the alt-right.

I know I'm going to be attacked on this point, but just because the right and racist policies happen to be bedfellows, that doesn't mean that everyone on the right is racist, and accusing everyone on the right of being racist adds a weird fuel to their fire and they feel like they need to defend themselves, and when you get wrong why they believe what they do it actually just entrenches them in their beliefs and makes them think the left is stupid and doesn't get it.  

It's like saying everyone on the left is a SJW Tumblrina who wants to cut off their sons' dicks and raise them as girls.  Hell, just give /r/the_donald a peruse and see how they misrepresent the left.  It's not constructive when either side does it.  It's just divisive and it's bullshit.  

The phrase ""Make America Nazi Free Again,"" is an obvious play on ""Make America Great again,"" and will obviously associate Trump and his supporters with Nazis.  It's designed to.  That was obviously intentional.  

Trump supporters have also been having to fend off accusations of being Nazis, so they're a bit defensive about it.  This was obviously meant to play off of those insecurities.  

Trump supporters who are also white nationalists/supremacists are the Trump supporters that have most been in the spot light.  

So we have a situation where Bethesda made some troll bait by associating Nazis with Trump Slogans in a way that could be interpreted multiple ways, a subset of Trump supporters taking the bait because they're defensive because the current narrative is focusing on white supremacists, and people mad at trump supporters without empathy toward them who will latch onto anything that paints Trump and his supporters negatively (and racism is an easy one.)  So we have trolls, people who took the bait, and people who delight in believing that they're all racists because they don't fully understand them.  

It's just super obvious marketing.  It's manufactured controversy because all the pieces are so easy, and the disgusting part is that everyone seems to be falling for it.  Left and right.

2. They were occupying the country - it was an act of war. They were also generally in power. They engaged in human rights abuses, and they were a centralized force.

Yellers on the street are currently in a democratic liberty nation - it's not even clear whether they advocate for killings, occupations and oppression until you actually hear them say that; and allowing violence against political opinions (*especially* those who're only indirectly associated with actual anti-liberty thought, rather than being such itself) can turn back around on you, and send the nation on a slippery slope down to chaos and/or tyranny.

If you're on the other hand in a situation where violence (with all the unstable repercussions and backfirings it can bring) is *necessary* and preferable to the risk of destabilizing your current situation - well, then your current situation is already fucked (war, lawlessness, oppression etc.) and it's not a state of affairs you want to arrive at from here.

I believe so yes. I should mention that I haven't actually read the book as I've never seen anything close enough to intellectual honesty from D'Souza to make me think it's worth my time to listen to him. 

>I should say, however, that advocating physical violence against those who espouse ideas that you don't like is fascist behavior itself. Point out the flaws in their reasoning, the hypocrisy, and the massive amounts of projection. It's more effective than making them martyrs.

Going to have to disagree with you here. Before I go any further let me be clear about something: I take the point that allowing the mob to determine who is and isn't deserving of a kick in the face can lead to all kinds of bad outcomes even if I'm skeptical that the problem of misidentification leading to violence is as common as some on this thread would lead us to believe. 

That said, if we're talking in a more abstract sense about whether it's ok to respond with physical violence to somebody who is a Nazi then I think that's 100% acceptable. To be clear I'm not saying somebody that you *think* is a Nazi, I'm not saying somebody that holds particular right-wing views that I find abhorrent, I'm saying an actual blood and soil Nazi. The reason I would argue that it is NOT fascistic is because Nazism, by it's very nature, demands the wholesale murder of so-called racial ""enemies"" and other undesirables generally. If you're say, a black person, and you run up against a Nazi I don't see any reason why that black person is *morally* in the wrong for reacting with violence. By virtue of that Nazi identifying with Nazism he or she is implicitly agreeing with the premise that the black person in our example is less than human and at best should look forward to a life of slavery and at worst should be murdered outright. If that's the case I see no compelling reason why the black person in our example should be expected to keep his or her cool in the face of somebody *who would gladly murder them if they could so without repercussions.*

The obvious retort here is that as long as it's still just speech then they haven't done anything yet. I don't actually find that to be a terribly convincing argument because if you're willfully advocating violence to an entire group of people based on their inherent characteristics then you may not engage in the violence yourself but you are supporting it and furthermore you are actively trying to bring it about through your advocacy. In that situation I see no moral distinction between a stormtrooper and Goebbels just because one isn't directly engaging in the violence themselves. The fact remains that the mouthpiece is still using the resources available to them to advocate for the dehumanization and murder of a broad swathe of people. Before somebody comes along and says ""Isn't that what you're doing right now?"" let me clarify. I'm not doing that because I'm not saying that anybody deserves to be harmed by virtue of immutable, uncontrollable characteristics about themselves, I'm saying that some ideas are so odious and harmful to society at large that confronting them with violence is acceptable recourse.

I want to take a moment to touch on this point:
>Point out the flaws in their reasoning, the hypocrisy, and the massive amounts of projection. It's more effective than making them martyrs.

I understand what you're saying and in a perfect world I would actually agree with you. I'm just very skeptical that people, on the whole, are rational enough to be persuaded by argument about things like Nazism. I think that by and large if you're a space where you're seriously considering Nazism as a political affiliation then you won't be dissuaded by argument because it's an ideology almost completely devoid of any intellectual content. Nazism is all pathos all the time because its core ideas are based on ideas of race that we've known are bullshit since the 1970s. Certainly there are some who can be dissuaded through argument and I don't want anybody to have the impression that I think violence against this sort of thing should be the FIRST response necessarily, only that it ought to be an acceptable response depending on the context. I think that way more people are persuaded by demagoguery and grandstanding than reasoned discussion and for that reason I think it's incredibly dangerous to be engaging with Nazism in anything resembling a forum that might give legitimacy to those ideas. Not because I think there's anything intellectually compelling about Nazism but because I think that the intellectual bankruptcy of Nazism is no defense against people glomming onto it for a whole host of other reasons more related to identity than thought. That being the case I think that if you make it clear that Nazism won't be tolerated by anybody for any length of time then you provide a deterrent to those who might find it attractive for the reasons I just mentioned. It's one thing to say ""I think that guy is saying a lot of things that other people aren't willing to say! Just like me!"" it's another for that same person to decide that identifying with those people is worth risking a punch in the face.",2017-10-07 17:55:33,2,

Do you honestly think that the government wouldn't be above stripping **your** rights when you sign in laws restricting the flow of information when someone who is fundamentally against your ideology is elected?

Your examples with Hitler are not applicable; we are not in an age of a crippled economy and national suffering. We are not in any age where the American people are being subjected to ridiculous inflation and a need to get out of destitution at any means necessary. We haven't been knocked down from a world power to a war-torn failing democratic republic. What is a problem is that people are more than willing to strip the rights of others (even if it would bite them in the ass later) and attack people over their political ideology. My grandparents had lived through Fascist Italy; if you want Fascism and the like to spread, attacking a fucking ideology in which the core tenet is **Direct Violent Action** does nothing but give them more chances to grow. You attack them, they claim self-defense and also claim that they are the party of law and order. They did this with the Spartacists and other Communist and Socialist parties in the Weimar Republic and they will surely do this again. You attack their freedom of speech, they make appeals and protest that get people who believe in freedom of speech to fight for their rights. Nazis other similar ideologues are a hornet's nest; you poke it and you lose, and ultimately doing nothing is a loss in itself. To destroy the nest is to forgo any values of liberty and democracy you think you have.

We are not the Weimar Republic. Barbarism has no place in our politics; we either accept their freedom of speech or we sign our own away when groups like the Evangelicals (or any other group like this) starts claiming that those darn atheists said mean, hateful things about them that are no where near what the Nazis have said.  However, if they start violently protesting and rioting like some of their anarchist counterparts, I see no reason not to quash their riots by force.

And before you say ""we didn't win WWII by debating the Nazis"", that my friend is a false equivalence. We're talking a domestic problem, not a despotic regime declaring war on us. Unlike Climate Change, where there are some (debatable) statistics and scientists going against it (the infamous posts about the Roman and Minoan Warmings), most people don't think an ideology that wants to wipe out most of the human race including themselves if they're not ""Aryan"" enough is a sensible position. Most people don't think that living under a state similar to George Orwell's ""1984"" is anywhere near sensible. Most people don't believe in ideological tenets like direct violent action.

I'd point out that being trans is kind of something you deal with on a lifelong basis, they were trans but just not out (same way someone like Rock Hudson was always gay as shit, he just wasn't out yet).  I'd also note that more and more people are recognizing that there's definitely some level of trans subtext within the film, so it isn't really irrelevant to point out in a context like this.

If you're interested on the subtext:

The big scene that makes it pretty obvious is the final fight with Agent Smith in the subway: Smith drags him onto the tracks and talking about the sound of impending death before saying goodbye to Neo by calling him Mr Anderson.  The beat of this scene centers on Neo exclaiming ""My name is Neo!"" before narrowly escaping death, and seemingly finally accepting that he *is* The One.   The name element is pretty obvious(his survival hinges on that single moment of asserting his identity as Neo, an identity he had once kept hidden and parallel to his 'real'
 life); but it's also worth keeping in mind that as a teenager, due to dysphoria, Lana wrote a suicide note before going to an empty subway station and nearly throwing herself onto the track.

American politics has gotten very interesting in the last ten years.

The militia movement barely existed until the end of 2008. That's when the United States chose a president who several tens of millions of Americans firmly believed was a black communist Muslim, born in Kenya and elected to take away their guns, put them in FEMA-run concentration camps, and subvert the American government into a communist, fascist Muslim theocracy forever.

Let's ignore how several of those concepts are mutually exclusive, because regardless of reality or how political theory works, that's what millions of people in the United States were convinced of after 2008, thanks to a corporation founded with the intent of creating a profitable, self-sustaining domestic propaganda machine.

And those people vote.

If that was an accurate, 100% truthful description of your country's  leadership, and it was only a matter of time before those elected officials moved to take over the country and implement their agenda, what would be the ethical response?

How far should you go when the other side is gathering strength and planning to eliminate your democratic government and replace it with an unholy fusion of Nazi Germany, the 1950's Soviet Union, and 1979 Iran, while opening your borders to allow millions of Jihadists to set up their own ISIS-style local governments everywhere?",2017-10-07 16:32:16,2,

I don't know what you're basing that off other than personal bias, but data shows otherwise. How many people on the ""alt-right"" do you know who self identify as liberals?

>â€œanti SJWâ€ segment

""SJW""s represent a growing and disturbing trend of people on the left who disavow or disregard foundational ideals of the traditional left like free speech and free expression. They're what I tend to call the ""authoritarian left"", and many classical liberals and leftists are opposed to them. Nearly all the popular ""anti SJW"" figures I can think of identify either as liberals or libertarians.

Especially if you can show them that it's in their self-interest to do so?  I believe that people can, especially if you can show how something could negatively or positively affect them.  If I had to guess, this would be the root of our disagreement.  If I'm right about that, how could you ever trust the judgement of a person to determine when violence should be used against someone who espouses an opinion that they disagree with?

You're naive if you believe the violence would ever stop once we go down that road.  When you have protesters who start assaulting those that they perceive as Nazis (I know that you had a hyper-specific example, but I'm trying to discuss real world applications.), you're going to create martyrs.  All of those disaffected whites that voted for Trump will respond in kind.  They already consume a wholly different media than we do, thanks to confirmation bias in the selection of media becoming socially acceptable.  Their media's outrage machine will go nuts and then you'll really have violence on your hands.

Intellectually honest debate isn't for the Nazis themselves.  The discussion and debate is for the viewers as you'll rarely convince an ideologue.  It's also not a ""perfect world"" scenario, it's a scenario that has taken into account just how effective conservative media is in creating boogeymen and uniting those who consume their media.  If you believe that violence is ever okay to stifle some ideal, then you've not spent the time required considering the outcome.

I sure as hell cannot trust the judgement of some of the protesters from the left either.  If you think that we aren't just as likely to get wrapped up in a confirmation bias fueled mob rage then that should give you pause.  

>The reason I would argue that it is NOT fascistic is because Nazism, by it's very nature, demands the wholesale murder of so-called racial ""enemies"" and other undesirables generally.

It doesn't necessarily necessitate genocide.  I've spent quite a lot of time trying to understand the groups that attended the Charlottesville protests and the ideals that they espouse.  It seems that the Nazis and the White Nationalists want an ethnostate or want to limit immigration as a way to keep whites as the majority.  Whether or not they've tried to dress up their idiotic views for better mainstream consumption is arguable.  Either way, I will not try to rationalize the use of their methods by those on my side, especially by such a subjective measure (morals).  History has shown us time and time again that it doesn't end well.

Whether or not that's actually happening to them, they believe that there are people that consider them to be a Nazi regardless of how much they state they aren't.

Combine that with what you just said. To them, you just advocated for preemptive physical violence against Nazis. Based on how quick you were to label people Nazi apologists that should burn in hell and how afraid they are they that others will think they are a Nazi, they assume you would label them as such. They now fear you would use violence against them. They fear their safety is at risk because of your threat.

Now following your logic, if they attacked you first, it would be an acceptable action done in self-defense. This is just the tip of the iceberg of where this ""logic"" leads. I hesitate to call it logic because, although there are some local connections to be found, they are bound together by assumptions driven by fear. 

Fear that assumes the worst perspective of someone, their intent, and their predicted actions are reality. Fear that leads to people demonizing and dehumanizing others in the name of safety and self-defense.

The same kind of fear that pushed our politics to where it is now. The same kind of fear that our current president relied on to get votes. That he has continued to rely on since assuming office.

Deterrence is the best defense. Not offense. Not provocation. Make it apparent that attacking you is too risky and difficult. Be a hard target. Don't make them think you're an immediate threat. Instilling fear in others by threatening to act first backs them into a corner. That causes survival instinct to kick in, logic disappears, they attack first. To them, they have nothing left to lose since not acting first means death. At that point, all you can do is try to minimize the harm inflicted on you. Whereas deterrence means no attack is attempted and no harm is done. This is basically the foundation of any effective security policy.

I genuinely don't know how you can talk about unopposed leftist politics, every single even moderately left wing movement gets a shitload of resistance from everyone to centrists to the far right (and not to mention a lot of moderate liberals) so I very much disagree with you there. Like, a small example here is people disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn's planned policies to give school dinners to kids in the UK because he was on the left - not because of the plan nor the implications thereof, just because he is a leftist.

On your racism point, I disagree entirely and emphatically and points like ""if you open your eyes, everyone is racist"" are the EXACT THING that is getting people calling you a Nazi. I am the whitest of white people and my place in society is not being 'given up' nor am I being shamed into giving it up, I'm personally supporting and working for a world where EVERYONE has a place in society, fundamental human rights and equality are not a limited resource, even if you're a hardcore conservative.

> I am naming those because everyone knows these. You are correct in that they might not be related since the ""good"" nazis didn't want to subscribe to the nazi ideology.

There were no ""good Nazis"" in the Nazi ranks. The paramilitary corps of loyalists and officers was comprised of the Sturmabteilung (SA, most commonly referred to as 'brownshirts') and the Schutzstaffel (SS). The military was comprised of the Wehrmacht. If you were Wehermacht, you most likely volunteered out of a sense of patriotic defense of country or were conscripted depending on which half of the war we're discussing and most likely didn't have a good understanding of what was going on in the prison camps (though the Wehermacht committed their own war crimes against the Soviets).

The concentration camp and main atrocities that people associate with the Holocaust were carried out under the SS. Those that enlisted and served in the SS were the true believers. They were the scum upon which modern Neonazis base their ideals of paramilitarism and racism upon. There are no Neonazi organizations carrying around Wehrmacht flags, as they carry around adapted Neonazi symbols from SA and SS symbology such as the SS flag, the Hakenkreuz (Nazi swastika), the Totenkopf (Nazi skull), the Wolfsangel, and other adapted runic symbols associated with SS military divisions.

There were no ""good Nazis"" in the SA or SS. These people committed atrocity after atrocity and were completely aware of what they were doing.

Nazism was pro-private business, Communism was pro-public owned business. 

Nazism was anti-organized labor, Communism was pro-organized labor. 

Nazism was anti-class conflict, Communism was pro-class conflict.

Nazism was pro-conflict between nations, Communism was anti-conflict between nations (yes it is splitting hairs but ideologically they viewed wars as a class struggle not a national struggle).

Nazism was anti-women in politics, Communism was pro-women in politics.

Nazism had an extreme racial identity, Communism did not, workers were workers. 

Nazism wanted religion to work for them, Communism outright dismissed religion. 

Both were authoritarian. 

Nazism was anti-capitalism for various reason but mostly that it threatened, in various forms, the peoples relationship with the nation. Communism was anti-capitalism because it rewarded those who had the means of production at the expense of those who did not and therefore had to sell their labor.  

It is a little simplistic. Most people just look at the terms and say well ""national socialism is half a step away from communism"" where socialism in German had nothing to do with Marxism in any form. Marxism was an economic theory that sorta boiled down to everything was everyones property and you got out of something what you put in with a lot of limitations on other things (like democratic elections) in order for things to function. National Socialism was more along the lines of subordinating your personal interest for the good of the nation or community and all your work was intent on serving your nation.

I am not even going to touch about whether or not all the dictators mentioned were lefty or righty. I will add that the United States and Australia practiced genocide on the native populations of their respective continents, so.... Was all this actually how things were/worked?

Some of this is from memory so it's not perfect - but during the campaign Hillary tried to ""flip"" Trumps campaign slogan by implying ""Ameirca is already great"".  The general attempt fell flat and was largely forgotten.

This issue currently is the phrasing and what we can imply through political rehtoric.

Lets take the two messages ""Make America Great Again"" and ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" (the slogan in the game marketing).

Well if we take these two messages side by side - first and foremost - one is absolutely cribbed from the other - there is no disputing this.  And secondly, side by side, it adopts the same sort of ""stance"" as what Hillary's campaign attempted during 2016.  Imply making america great (again) was redundant.

If viewed from this framing it puts ""make America America again"" as the opposing stance against the message it's cribbing from - a ""correction"" much like what the Hillary Campaign tired.   If that's the case then the message ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" is challenging would place it by default on the ""other side"" - in this case ""The Nazi side"".

There is more to it than just the above but the above is a good general framing as to why it's disingenuous to write-off conservatives being upset about this as them de-facto trying to defend Nazis.   Conservative offense in this case, at least from what I can see - isn't being taken because people are attacking Nazis - it's because people are attacking conservatives being lumped in via campaign slogan cribbing *with* Nazis - when for over the last year they've been painted as Nazis 24/7 by their political opponents.

This is just one more Godwins law throwdown.  - And those seeking to ""pile on"" are being purposely obtuse about the complaints from Conservatives. ",2017-10-07 19:44:21,1,

We pre-ordered (sic) tickets online and had a plan to set up an original Xbox in the back of a minivan so we could play Halo 1 Multiplayer on the way to the theater, even though it was only like 20 minutes away.

My friend's mom drops us off at the mall and we take our seats in the theater. We're pumped, but a few minutes before the movie starts, the ushers for the theater start going around and verifying that everyone in the theater was of the right age to see the movie. If you were underage or without a parent, you were going to be kicked out.

My three friends and I are fucking panicking. The kids a few rows in front of us are getting walked out of the theater and we're thinking we're next.

All of the sudden, the man next to me starts fucking yelling at me, saying, ""I swear to god. If you go see an R rated movie without me or your mother, I'm ground you for a month."" The usher hears him and just moves onto the next row.

I said to the man, something like ""Gee, thanks mister.""

>Taking a boot to their face is sure to fire them up, though

Dude, a fascist's default and only state is ""fired up"", there is no such thing as a peaceful fascist. The fact that they advocate for things like belligerent nationalism, genocide, racial supremacy, ethnic cleansing, etc. (pick a few of those depending on which facet of the alt-right you're talking about) means that they're violent and destructive by default.

This is like blaming the US Civil Rights movement for ""firing up"" the KKK. They were already fired up, the Civil Rights movement just put them on the defensive: because it was an effective threat to them.

>Thanks ANTIFA. 

Do you know antifa's history? The movement started in Germany in 1932 as a counter to fascists because *nobody else was trying to stop them*. The Nazis were already dangerous, they did just fine making up an ""enemy"" in Jews, communists, etc.

>Their whole narrative is that they're a subjugated people, and if we go around punching them out when they go out in public, doesn't that make it a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy?

Their whole schtick is that they only really exist in political environments where their scapegoating (against Jews, black people, leftists, Muslims, Mexicans, whatever works) is already more attractive than reality. That's why Trump winning was a big deal to the alt-right: not because he's a fascist, but because he showed just how effective blaming everything on minorities is right now.

If they're around, it's because they've already effectively created their own fake ""enemy"" and it's working. Having an actual opposition doesn't change anything, except for the better.

If I'm right about that, how could you ever trust the judgement of a person to determine when violence should be used against someone who espouses an opinion that they disagree with?

To be clear, I absolutely believe that they CAN. What I'm skeptical about is the degree to which that process occurs en masse. I think things like socioeconomic status and cultural identity play a much, much bigger role in the political positions people take than rational discourse does. 

I actually think you have a valid point about how that makes it difficult to trust people to correctly identify who should properly be considered a Nazi and thus a fair target for violence. I was intentionally avoiding getting into specifics because my chief contention was with the idea that violence against Nazis is in some way morally equivalent to Nazi violence against others which I just think is categorically false because intentions and motivation for violence absolutely matter. That's what makes murder different from self-defense. I think the question of whether it's practical to engage in that sort of violence against actual Nazis in the context of the modern US is a more difficult and fraught question. Furthermore I don't actually know where I come down on that particular question, hence my insistence on talking in the abstract. 

Another point of difference that we have I think is you mention that if Nazis are responded to with violence the conservative mediasphere will lose it's ever-loving mind, create martyrs out of those who have been attacked and encourage their viewers to violence. I think that they're already doing that and I think they've been doing that for quite some time before Trump. The kind of shit spewing out of the conservative media during the Obama years was often implicitly or explicitly racist, violent and reactionary. I don't think they're going to stop and I find it difficult to believe that violence on the part of the left is going to make their already absurd hyperbole any worse. 
>It doesn't necessarily necessitate genocide. I've spent quite a lot of time trying to understand the groups that attended the Charlottesville protests and the ideals that they espouse. It seems that the Nazis and the White Nationalists want an ethnostate or want to limit immigration as a way to keep whites as the majority. Whether or not they've tried to dress up their idiotic views for better mainstream consumption is arguable.

You mention that it's arguable and that would certainly be my contention. I think there's all kinds of good reasons to think that they're just lying about this particular point. Even if they're not they certainly advocate making non-whites second class citizens at absolute best. I realize you said this was arguable I just want to make it clear that I trust the word of avowed white nationalists as far as I can throw them and don't actually care how they dress up their bigotry. 

> Either way, I will not try to rationalize the use of their methods by those on my side, especially by such a subjective measure (morals). History has shown us time and time again that it doesn't end well.

I get what you're saying here but that's sort of a meaningless statement isn't it? Of course morality changes and some of what was broadly acceptable 50 years ago isn't necessarily acceptable now and vice versa. That doesn't really matter though. We're wrong about things all the time, we still do the best we can with the knowledge and frameworks we have. Taking a stance about whether or not to use violence on Nazis is itself a moral position. Incidentally, history also teaches us the consequences of not confronting anti-democratic forces before they are able to seize control in a democratic system using the privileges extended to them by democracy to undermine that system.

>I really don't mean to sound combative throughout this post. I wish text was more efficient at displaying tone or I were more suited to word this in a more effective way. Sorry if this comes off as assholish.

You don't come off as assholish at all but I appreciate the attempt to clarify. I don't mean to be combative either. This is an imperfect medium for somebody like me to express my ideas on a topic this complex since I'm much at better at expressing myself through speech.

And that not all attempts to use a DA are going to be for something as clearly black and white as an argument for racism. Bad ideas stand out on their own, no matter who is arguing for them. Genocide, for example, is wrong. Not because Hitler, a bad person, advocated for it but because it's inherently an evil thing. 

That said; I agree completely with not feeding Trolls. They ""win"" when you choose to feed them. However, not all expressions of negative views are based in the goal of being hateful. I believe there is a divide between being hateful and simply being ignorant. For example.

I live in a city that's pretty diverse. In the past I have had family visit from another state, where their hometown is almost entirely white. They have never interacted with a black person before and were very prejudiced against them, expressing a lot of racist stereotypes. It wasn't that they harbored any hate for them, they simply bought into what they had seen on TV. 

Japan, for another example, is generally pretty damn racist. Mostly towards other Asian nations, but they depict black people in a very negative stereotypical way. I have seen a lot of people say ""Well, fuck em. How dare they"". But the Japanese aren't hatefully racist towards black people, just ignorant of them. Their demographic is 98% Japanese. The vast majority will live their entire lives and never see someone of another race. 

In both cases, a little knowledge can change and better a person. Ignorance is easier to cure than hatred, its just hard to tell them apart. People *should* seek to correct their ignorance on their own, but sadly, people rarely go out of their way to counter a learned bias. 

For your last point on supporting playing Devils Advocate; I think you could call my argument here a DA. I attempted to explain and reason why Japan is so clearly racist. Not as a troll and not as a cover for some other bigotry. Just as a counter to the idea that ""The Japanese are a bunch of shitty racists"". A good DA is asking someone to dig a little deeper in a situation where the surface belief may not be the whole story. A bad DA is asking people to dig up something that's already pretty obvious.

Amongst a variety of reasons which would introduce critical failure on their own, Germany's military economy simply wasn't enough to keep up with the rest of the world's.

For all his regime's advanced technology, Hitler was never close to winning the war. It is, however, entertaining to think of what the world might look like if he had the power to win - and that's why I play Wolfenstein.",2017-10-08 04:37:25,1,

For max splatter, you may want to try and free piss into the bowl prior to filling it with cheerios. You can stand on the table or climb a tree if outside in order to really get maximum effect from the gravity, and as a bonus afterwards you can pour the cheerios in and create more splatter.  

You could try and place your bowl of cheerios at the bottom of a slide, and piss onto the top of the slide and drain into the bowl. This seems inefficient though.. 

You could piss into a pot of spaghetti and cook it, then drain the piss into the cheerios bowl and serve the pasta to your rival Todd from accounting. Damned Todd.  

What about pissing upside down? That could be a fun but highly risky endeavor for obvious reasons.  

If you really wanted to impress a lady or friends, piss into the wind and have it land in the bowl of cheerios. Don't forget the sugar, ladies love sweets!  

You could star in a golden shower porno and strategically place bowls of cheerios around. Inefficient? Yes, but sexy if piss is your thing. 

Attach a vacuum to the end of your member and place a bowl of cheerios in the bag. Some of those dysons make it very easy to change the bag so I would guess the gained efficiency would allow this strategy to scale into things like homeless shelters and schools. Piss Cheerios for everyone! This very well could be the most efficient way to cover cheerios in piss. 

Don't flush a low flow toilet for a while and you will have a reserve of piss ready to go for your cheerios.  High flow toilets can yield a greater volume but this really only works if you have somewhere else to shit. At least that is what my friend told me.  

And last, purchase one of those Asian restaurants that have the sushi on a belt, and replace the sushi with cheerios, then just have your employees get bloody drunk and once they break the seal you can flip on the conveyor belt and get a good piss-on-cheerio/hour going.

But he accepted an interview from Breitbart where he was asked questions that also had *absolutely nothing* to do with Nazi socialism. But, what do you know, JonTron was branded a Nazi for associating with them. 

So we have people that would gladly take his rights as a free American away... over literally nothing. And thats before you bring the ""punch a nazi"" violence into the equation. 

Everyone who was critical of the Wolfenstein ad was branded a nazi. That means they have no right to speech or safety... because they didnt like politics fucking around in their video game. And not because of any views on Nazi socialism. In what world is that fair or just. ",2017-10-07 06:21:49,12,

Let's say Trump started installing gassing chambers tomorrow - how many of his supporters do you think would actually support that? How many conservatives would be on board. I know a lot of Trump supporters (I live in a conservative area and work with the military) and I can honestly say that I believe 100% of the conservatives I know would revolt against this action.

They aren't Nazis - at best they're isolationists and maybe a bit xenophobic. I don't know any white supremacists, I don't know any racists. OK, maybe 1 or 2 racists - but even they are anti-Nazi.

This jump from ""Trump is a piece of shit who says some stupid hateful things"" to ""Trump is a Nazi"" is a problem because it's not true and it makes liberals look desperate - it makes them look like they're looking for a cheap knockout instead of actually making arguments.

6353,3434.0,Hamakua,"Not the person you replied to but I'd like to share a perspective and what I think is going on and where all the outrage is coming from.

Some of this is from memory so it's not perfect - but during the campaign Hillary tried to ""flip"" Trumps campaign slogan by implying ""Ameirca is already great"".  The general attempt fell flat and was largely forgotten.

This issue currently is the phrasing and what we can imply through political rehtoric.

Lets take the two messages ""Make America Great Again"" and ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" (the slogan in the game marketing).

Well if we take these two messages side by side - first and foremost - one is absolutely cribbed from the other - there is no disputing this.  And secondly, side by side, it adopts the same sort of ""stance"" as what Hillary's campaign attempted during 2016.  Imply making america great (again) was redundant.

If viewed from this framing it puts ""make America America again"" as the opposing stance against the message it's cribbing from - a ""correction"" much like what the Hillary Campaign tired.   If that's the case then the message ""~~Make America America Again~~ Make America Nazi Free again"" is challenging would place it by default on the ""other side"" - in this case ""The Nazi side"".

There is more to it than just the above but the above is a good general framing as to why it's disingenuous to write-off conservatives being upset about this as them de-facto trying to defend Nazis.   Conservative offense in this case, at least from what I can see - isn't being taken because people are attacking Nazis - it's because people are attacking conservatives being lumped in via campaign slogan cribbing *with* Nazis - when for over the last year they've been painted as Nazis 24/7 by their political opponents.

This is just one more Godwins law throwdown.  - And those seeking to ""pile on"" are being purposely obtuse about the complaints from Conservatives. ",2017-10-07 19:42:18,0,

Just because it doesn't affect you now doesn't mean it won't affect you later on.

Let me get your perspective on this then since you seem to be a smart guy: if I wanted to defend free speech, how would I do it without being accused of being anything related to Nazis? How would I do it without wishing injury or death to someone, like wanting ""Nazi scalps"" or ""bash the fash"" or whatever the slogan is today? Supporting free speech means allowing everyone to speak freely, including allowing genuine Nazi scumbags to speak freely about their ideology.

Im not pretending to be an expert on marxist philosophy, but I have read the communist manifesto, I have spoken to many communists, and I take an interest in the history if communism, and I know that one of the core tenets of marxist philosophy is that for communism to be established, first there must be a violent reckoning with the beorgoise, and historically the beorgoise has had a very broad definition for communists.

I was merely pointing out that youd have to prove the ideological purity if such a person - maybe they believe in the concept of an ethno state for instance but how do you know they also want to bring it about violently? â€œJust look at himâ€ is not sufficient legal grounds for a conviction of any crime.

Its like you literally ignored the rest of my post, people are mad that Bethesda used the trend/meme of calling conservatives nazis, thats what they're mad about. And there are potential consequences with this which I also talked about in my quote.


I'm not mad, I don't who anyone calls a nazi. But in the year of 2017 the us vs. them mentality of far right vs. far left has been causing a divide in the united states. It was already getting pretty stupid back in 2016 with tons of protests and rallys and stuff, but literally the far-left far-right push has been getting stronger. As time has been going on more and more media coverage and more political violence has been occurring. Like if people don't chill the fuck out soon it very well could end up being neonazis vs. neocommunists in a few years. This political BS drama has literally caused people to hurt each other in the timespan of less than a year of its existance and if it manages to continue to progress it very may well tear this nation apart.


Now the odds of that at this time are still pretty low, but the amount of strong emotional reactions to petty drama are still very high, and bethesda stirring the pot just to make money is pretty shitty of them. Like anyone who stirs the pot deserves outrage, because this shit is really a non issue when it comes to the every day lives of normal americans, but when the media and other people related to the media make it the focus of american politics, nothing really good or useful is going to come of it regardless if it ends in a commie vs nazi war or not.

If you do that by disrupting an anti-nazi protest I'd argue you've picked the wrong time to march and you've picked a weird hill to die on.  Also saying that guy was defending nazis is in no way inaccurate, his argument was to let them have a platform to tell their side.

>For whatever reason, if I don't 100% condone violence towards people you consider to be ""Nazis""

Drop this ""People I consider to be nazis"" bullshit.  I've told you what nazis are, do you disagree with that?  You're going to tell me that people publicly identifying as nazis, marching alongside nazis with a swastika banner and an armband, shouting about eliminating jews aren't nazis?  Consider this, it's not whether someone thinks the wrong thing or not, it's about the shit they say and do in public.

>if I wanted to defend free speech, how would I do it without being accused of being anything related to Nazis?

ACLU defended the nazi's right to protest.  Donate to the ACLU.  I think the oathkeepers show up to protests with nazis and antifa.  You could protest along with them, although they strike me as a largely racist group but I did hear reports of them defending antifa from proud boy types.  

But here's the thing with these people who go and protest antifa.  They're not protesting for free speech.  If that were the case they'd shot up to BLM protests and defend them from cops--they don't.  Tim Pool doesn't have videos of cops tear gassing free speech protesters standing up for BLM.  All of these people only show up when it's nazis and it's because they realize they're really close to potentially being called a nazi or getting beat up at these events because their views or abhorrent and unpalatable to the public.  

I'm extremely pro free speech myself, I'm sure it doesn't sound like it from this argument we've been having.  The issue for me is that it is an act of violence to publicly attempt to instigate an ethnic cleansing.  It falls just short of the actual crime of conspiracy to commit mass murder, but only because the people doing it are clearly not powerful enough to accomplish their publicly stated plan.

The reason Nazis debate is to spread their rhetoric to people receptacle to hate and Supremacy, and to sway people already toeing the line . They will spread rhetoric rather than actually argue points .

6517,3598.0,zasabi7,"Strictly speaking about the US, free speech is the greatest freedom our country enjoys.  Which is why it took me a long time to come to my conclusion: hate speech should be exempted from it's protection.  Here I define hate speech as public incitement against an identifiable group (race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.).

The key word here is public. It's impossible to stop someone from having a privately held belief and sharing it in confidence privately, but it is possible to silence the spreading of that belief through public channels.  By public channel, I mean anything that can identify the individual, so a speaking stage, an email chain, a web post (hardest to verify, but it's doable), a video, etc.

But why stop hate speech? It's been shown to cause actual harm (Words That Wound: Critical Race Theory, Assaultive Speech, and the First AmendmentÂ (Westview Press 1993)).  From my own experience, I can tell you my friends of color deal with some demons that I'll never have to.  My goal is that their progeny won't have the same issues and worries as them.

When I see groups like the KKK or the nut jobs waving Nazi flags in Charlottesville, it makes my blood boil.  Their speech represents an actual threat to my friends. I seek to silence that, and there are only two ways to do so: litigation or violence (you can argue that engaging them and converting them like members of the Black community have is also effective, but it's slow and it's not high yield. More over, it's hard to engage in this kind of dialogue when they have ideological echo chambers to reinforce them).

Despite my initial post, I don't want death or violence.  I don't trust anyone, myself included, to carry out such a task.  Thus I seek legal ways to destroy such bigotry.  Such speech has no value for me.  I cannot think of a scenario where hate speech can be shown in a positive light.  (This is important to me, because I wouldn't want Art to suffer.  Racists and bigots can still be shown in negative light or even in positive if they contributed something to society and that is what is being highlighted (Hitler being one of the best orators of all time as an example).  But if the point of a work is to suppress others, than I don't think it has value.)

So those are my thoughts. It's taken several years to arrive at this conclusion, and I'm sure I missed some of the building blocks I used to get here, but I hope it makes sense. More over, I hope it's rational.  Thanks for reading.",2017-10-07 20:00:58,2,

Actually this is incorrect. You *can* be prosecuted for ideas if the state can prove you planned to act on those ideas in a way that breaks the law. It's why people are imprisoned for conspiracy to murder. Even if you haven't done a single physical thing to break the law, if someone can show that you had the idea of breaking the law, the means to break it and the motive to break it, you can be arrested for conspiracy to commit a crime.

The *marketing* however is definitely playing on the political divisiveness of the current culture.  - beyond this point is more just my opinion.

The sense I'm getting from all of this is as follows

1.  Someone in a marketing department that Bethesda hired is left leaning and political
2.  Hating conservatives is in right now among ""Silicon valley"" and ""Left coast"" culture. - it's always in, but it's at a fever pitch right now.
3.  Some marketing figurehead thought ""lets poke the hornets nest for clicks and eyeballs"" - that it attacks their political opponents is just a bonus.
4.  The media, who is largely against the Trump's Presidency also is all for poking the hornets nest (this is for slightly different reasons).

So not only do you have a major corporation functionally using their platform to ""not so subtly"" attack a political side in American politics - but it does so rather unfairly.   [News media then also unfairly misrepresent the issue.](http://www.newsweek.com/nazi-video-game-wolfenstein-angers-nazis-make-america-nazi-free-again-slogan-679530)

I'm personally left leaning and even I got annoyed at the characterizations being made (the new far-cry tried to do something similar, but it was much more subtle).  Someone in the Bethesda chain of command gave the nod to poke the conservative hornets nest - functionally blanket calling them Nazis - then when they got upset about it the response was a ""Why are you upset about Nazi's getting killed?"" 

>Hurr durr, if you are offended by being called a Nazi - it must mean you are a Nazi

Only someone as dense as yourself would try to shift the burden of proof onto someone not making the claim. Asking for a source to trump's full quote is a legitimate question and your constant repeating of that bullshit paragraph isn't going to change it.

Unsurprisingly, your sources say nothing on what trump actually said, which is what the main topic of my comment is. I'm interested in the full contextual quotes of what Trump said, not the validity of *what he claimed trump said*. 

But you have a combination of being both dense and disingenuous at the same time, leading to the shameless projection, goalpost switching and lying found throughout all your comments. 

> since you seem dead set against doing your own research, 

You're incredibly relentless at trying to shift the burden of proof. You claimed he sourced what donald trump said; he didnt. Now you've switched goalposts to saying it was always *me* who should've done the research, and you wont give up this point no matter how stupid it sounds. 

I could say Donald Trump is a liar who got it wrong about charlottesville and BLM. That's an easily verifiable fact. No, I'm not going to provide a source to the quote because it's easy to google and find out yourself. See how bullshit an argument this is? Notice how I didn't source shit even though the burden of proof is on me? This is the kind of arguing you seem to support.

Here's how to beat the actual Nazis the right way: just let them speak. Seriously. Let them say whatever hateful rhetoric they want in peace. You know what's going to happen? People will be disgusted by what they say because their ideology is terrible. They won't support them, they won't take them seriously, and the Nazis will slowly go back into hiding; not with a bang, but with a whimper. It worked for decades and it kept them down.

Remember the Westboro Baptist Church? In a nutshell, they were preaching a lot of hate and death toward groups they didn't like. But did anyone rise up against them? No. The worse that happened to them was people swearing at them and flipping them off. No one supported them. What do you think would happen if they were physically attacked? Lawsuits, criminal charges against the attackers, news coverage, and the support from those who support free expression with more opportunities to spin their message in a positive light.

This is exactly what's happening with ""Nazis"" when you call for violence against them; you're just pushing more and more rational people to side with them. That includes people of all races. [Charles Barkley is now a black ""white supremist"".](http://www.theroot.com/charles-barkley-is-a-great-example-of-a-black-white-su-1798149722) That sounds ridiculous, isn't it? That's because it is.

Identity politics are what started this whole thing to begin with. Rather than promoting equality, feminists claim to be oppressed and demand special treatment. Black people claim to be oppressed and demand special treatment. Mexicans claim to be oppressed and demand special treatment. Sooner or later, it's only natural for white people (particularly Nazis) to do the same thing. But nope, Nazi ideology called for genocide, therefore everyone needs to physically attack them for their speech, right? No, all you're really doing is legitimizing their grievances and emboldening them to push back harder. The ""punch a Nazi"" people punch harder, Nazis punch back harder, and continues to escalate from there with more and more people getting caught in the fray who are only given the choice between one side or the other.

The real solution to stop Nazis is to stop the violence, and to de-escalate the violence at this point, you need to condemn the violence from all sides, stop glorifying and praising violence towards anyone regardless of their affiliation, and highlight who's actually getting hurt in the conflict.

Sounds like a pretty strong condemnation, he wants to try it as a hate crime.

Gorka:

He seems like a jackass, but the only grounds to call him a ""nazi"" is support for some hungarian thing his father was part of. Considering how anti-semitism is really big in nazism, and he's super pro-israel, its just not a good fit.

--These nazis all want to genocide everybody but white people.

They killed more Slavs than Jews. The entire reason there aren't any Nazis today is because the messed with the wrong Slavs. 70% of Germans died fighting the Russians. Why is it that none of these modern so-called Neo Nazis bitch and moan about the Slavs?

Is it perhaps, because Nazi ideology is retarded in seeing a specific group of white people as a different race? Is it perhaps, because these modern so-called Neo Nazis are just white supremacist idiots, if even that? Really, what kind of mongoloid marches with tiki torches?

See, Wolfenstein is about the Nazis conquering America, and then having a resistance fighting against it. The Nazis in the game have power and are a maiority. Not only that, they're doing terrible things against other people that are being considered normal. It's obvious that you're going to have to kill them, since they'll try to kill you for stopping them. Just punch them, ffs.

In our timeline, however, the things are different. Nazis don't have power (last time I checked), they weren't a maiority, and they definitely do get backlash for doing shit. This means that it's fucking predictable that they're not going to do what they do in public to evite backlash. Like, if you see a nazi punching/killing someone for that person just being black, having diferent opinions or whatever, go for the fucking punch. But if you see the nazi just spewing his hate and expressing his opinions (how dumb they may sound), keep it cool, for fuck's sake. Nazis are only going to get bigger if you give then attention when they're not commiting unethic things or crimes.

They're going to dress up the nazis and put them at the forefront of every sign, they are going to promote them as a threat, they are going to give them the stage as much as possible, because when SJWs start their violence, they want everybody to think they're only being violent against nazis. Nazis are their best friends, their most valuable tools against opposition, because when they say they want to kill nazis, they're saying that they want to kill YOU, because that will be the label they pin on you, regardless of whether or not it fits.

7302,410.0,jo-ha-kyu,">The idea that the capitalist adds no value to the worker's product and they are essentially parasites on the working class.

This is mostly true; the value is usually added by the people who *don't* extract surplus value, including middle-managers, accountants, engineers, and right down to the manual machinist. The capitalist and his board of members and stockholders don't really add much value at all. And if they do, then it's *still* no reason to be extracting the value of those who do more work in perpetuity.

>Which basically amounts to politicized jealousy

The idea that those at the bottom rungs of society, or those who are systematically exploited, are simply jealous of the wealth of those with wealth is a laughable idea. The problem is not merely the existence of wealth inequality, but rather the conditions which force it to exist and the fact that wealth inequality *widens*, which means that people with more are getting richer, or people with less are getting poorer. But with greater profits comes greater exploitation; the quality of life for those people decreases even though their wages stay the same. Either way, Communism isn't about reducing wealth inequality, it's about abolishing wealth in private property all together. 

>How is capital an oppressive force?

Capital is what creates the compulsion for the worker to either work for a wage or to starve, and it creates the class hierarchies which are necessary to maintain capitalism. It creates a strange compulsion for the owner of capital to devote all of his time and care to this single aspect of his ego - greed - in case he loses any. Finally, it has effects on our psychological well-being through the process of alienation and production for exchange. It poses a restrictive, hollow freedom, ironically which our freedom from this freedom (i.e the freedom from the freedom to work or starve) can be achieved only by eliminating that which sustains capital - wage labour.

Also, most Communists aren't in favour of cooperative organisations as ""Communism"". Communism is not merely ""workers owning a workplace"", it's the removal of exchange and wages by making them unnecessary. Coops have their own problems, and not everyone can work in a coop, or there would be no way to develop further.",2017-10-13 20:54:11,1,

Jealousy can be valid, being jealous is not inherently bad, but engaging in and gaining political power on the back of the idea that it's bad that Person A has more money than Person B, because...reasons is manipulative and doing the very thing I was talking about originally regarding how communism inherently makes wealthy people part of the society the ""other"" while at least nazism seeks to ""other"" an ethnic/religious minority. 
And I don't see how the lower classes are exploited, I've looked at communist ideas on this and I find them incredibly wanting and basically suffering the same problems of emotive language and thinking over analytical thinking. 
And objectively people are not getting poorer, there may be increasing wealth disparity but that doesn't mean there's then less wealth, again.
To me the idea of abolishing private wealth is insanely tyrannical and completely misunderstands both human nature and the role of property in human society.
Again, what if people like me don't want to submit? What about the Socialist Calculation Problem?



Regarding capital
How would capital force workers into a work or starve situation? I mean there were humans before humans had the need for capital, meaning they couldn't have survived if what you say is true, meaning we couldn't be having this conversation. 
No, every living thing must consume to sustain itself. Capitalism or capital doesn't dictate that, the nature of our existence dictates that. Prior to capitalism, the food didn't plant and harvest itself, no people always had to work to survive. ",2017-10-13 21:30:21,3,

7353,461.0,throwawaycuzmeh,"First: I think we can safely define context, in substantial part, as a combination of time and place.

I conceive of the internet/cultural meme as largely a construction of ""now"". Internet/culture memes are also, generally, transient and temporary things. They tend to be tied to a specific item or event. This makes it difficult to claim distance or independence from those items or events when you evoke the meme in a supposedly unrelated context - especially when the context of origin rages all around you. 

By contrast, tropes are, almost necessarily, a product of history; something functions well over time and becomes a routine and predictable ""standard"". Tropes are archetypical, applicable in many times and places. There's a degree of highly plausible deniability there with respect to meaning and interpretation, mostly because tropes tend to be so old and well-worn that it would be impossible to isolate their context.

Even then, some tropes can become temporarily inappropriate based on current events. The trope of the wronged man out for bloody vengeance is potentially justifiably upsetting when you're society has just suffered a massive violent event, which is why Netflix is delaying the punisher until people are less traumatized by the Vegas shooting. 

Anita attacks tropes that are either deeply embedded within our collective history/biology *or* that are not even particularly legitimate as tropes. Her answer to the Vegas shooting would be to never release the punisher at all. In fact, no one should be making such things in the first place. 

In summation: I guess you could say I respect a certain amount of deference to current events and especially combustible situations when it comes to caricaturing people, places, and things. I reject anything resembling a permanent or absolute ban on such expressions, though.

I very much respect that and agree. I definitely see the reason to respectfully distance one self to events where recent tragedy happened.

I think our only point of difference is that in my opinion the ""MAGA"" meme is distant enough to justify its use without me morally objecting to the use. Like I said earlier I believe  that ""MAGA"" moved beyond its political roots and into international meme territory. Thus I dont really believe one should judge it in the context of its political origin.

7435,,mamercus-sargeras,"In marketing/sales there is an acronym called AIDA: attention - interest - decision - action. More attention doesn't necessarily translate into more sales. 

I actually do work in marketing and sales and being told to sell stuff no matter what often creates more problems than it solves: bad reviews, bad reputation, returns, chargebacks, cancellations, and even lawsuits. Trying to make a bad deal work usually leads to disaster unless you're a criminal and are good at avoiding the consequences. 

I think the Wolf 2 marketing probably alienated a lot of people, especially because shooter fans are probably more right wing than, say, fans of 'Gone Home.' Game journalists are pretty much irrelevant to marketing most games. They are much less trusted than, say, car magazine reviewers, and surveys routinely back this up. The only time when politically tinged marketing is really safe to use is when it's actually relevant to the product. Some material about gun rights or self-defense is relevant if you are selling guns or gun accessories, for example. If you're soliciting political donations, your copy oughta be political. 

Otherwise, most Americans are politically unaffiliated and even the ones who are politically affiliated don't have strong beliefs about most things. The people who are both politically affiliated and have strong beliefs are a tiny but vocal and influential minority. 

For Wolf 2 in particular, I generally don't buy new games anyway so all pre-release marketing is just there to sucker in idiots who preorder things sight unseen. Wolf 1 needs a bunch of screwy modfiication to even run without failing to cache textures and other crap like that on PC even now, so Wolf 2 definitely gets a 'wait 3 years for it to be on sale for $5' regardless if BJ Blaskowitz gets a sex change halfway through the game or not.

If you want.  If people understand that marketing can be shady and opportunist, they're not going to have much sympathy when marketers reveal they didn't believe what they were saying but felt like they needed to sell the product no matter what. 

It's entertainment. It's what people do with the free time and money they have to enjoy themselves. Even if their motivations are completely unreasonable, they've gone through the steps to make sure they can act on their unreasonable ideas without having to deal with anyone else's bullshit for just a few hours.

7503,,Chipdogs,">The last 15 or so Call of Duty and Battlefield games would like to have a word with you. And about 5 Far Cry games. And 4 or so Uncharted games. 

You haven't actually played those games have you. 

All the recent Call of Duty games since Sarkeesian have female infantry, the last one even had 50% female enemies which was just retarded. Battlefield 3 had a civilian woman front and center who could magically fight as competently as battle hardened veterans, and who would shrilly scream orders in your ear. 

Amy Hennig, (who writes believable plausible stories and characters) wrote the first Uncharted games. Surprise surprise, when she got booted off the team for not being SJW enough, Uncharted 4 got this ridiculous sub plot about an invincible woman who couldn't even be beaten by two shredded 6 foot men.

>You can't even play as her in Wolfenstein. Is your masculinity really so frail that the mere *sight* of a strong women causes you to get upset? 

lol nice buzzword there, you're totally not a mindless cultist guzzling the kool aid are you?

Shoehorning ""strong women"" into a story about male soldiers fighting a war makes it trashy and campy. The writers are saying hey, we've built this dark violent world with death and war, but it's also an unrealistic candyland where women are magically as physically strong as men.

If these writers were really interested in creating interesting memorable female characters, they'd write the women with realistic strengths and weaknesses, who use their intelligence and empathy to solve problems. It's cool and exciting watching realistic female characters creatively get around the limitation of their physical weakness and lack of combat ability. Real women can't use violence and physical strength to solve their problems. They have to be smart instead.

>I find it amusing that women put up with playing *dozens* of games where they have to play a man, but even the mere sight of a women causes male gamers to melt down. 

Overemotional much? Yes, because I'm ""male gamers"" and this calm discussion is a ""melt down"". Do you ever think for yourself or is everything you write sucked straight from some feminist pseudoscience tract?

Women don't ""put up with"" anything, they don't play violent shooters like Wolfenstein in any significant number. The vast majority of videogames are gender neutral. Women have have a ton of games and entertainment media that appeal to them. There is no reason to pander to them. It's ok for men to have some things to themselves.",2017-10-27 21:22:49,3,102.0

He expresses his hatred for ""the man"", and ends up calling the main character, Blazko, little different from the Nazis to him.

Nazis.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally gymnastic bigotry. Over, and over, and overall for nothing more than a little promise of a solely white world.

We'll commit ourselves to doing things others would consider crimes against humanity, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time regurgitating bullshit to produce fictional stereotypes all to hide our own terrible insecurities.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the hate, all day, the same bad arguments over and over, hundreds of times to the point where everyone else knows every little detail such that some have attained such anti-Nazi nirvana that they can literally repeat our garbage verbatim.

Do these people have any idea how many of our faces have been smashed, brains over heated, relationships and careers destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to in a poorly edited youtube video?


These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're been building a new one without them. They take our heroes? Nazis aren't shy about throwing their money at other grifters, or even making shit content ourselves. They think calling us racist, misogynistic, incels is going to change us? We've been called worse things by every self-respecting woman with standards. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown extra sensitize to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition we've brought upon ourselves. Who take it as a slight when they tell us we no longer matter as much as we used to. Our obsession with other races after being told we're equal is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with decent people laughing at how pathetic we still are that proving you people right has become a very real fear; an economic anxiety

Nazis are assholes, cowards, by nature. We hate a challenge to our sensitivities. The best thing we did in all of this was to expose ourselves. Weâ€™re not special, weâ€™re not original, weâ€™re not the first; this is just another Third Reich.

Soviets never said that, Hitler definitely didn't. If they are referring to mass propaganda, they did, but I've yet to see any evidence that those topics are propaganda.

> the use of popular media to push their policies as morally superior rather than simply better or more practical

I think literally every political party on earth does this, or at least their supporters do.

But if the German political majority starts saying ""no more rats,"" you the Jew that has been called a rat for a few years now is gonna panic.

You can sorta ignore the old classic 2D Wolfenstein games. Frankly the most important plot point there is ""You play as B.J. Blazkowicz and you killed Hitler."" If you're looking to see the creation of FPSes as a genre tho, it's a really cool game.

One game you could start with 2001's Return to Castle Wolfenstein. It's a pretty good game, and sets up who Deathshead is.

There's also 2009's Wolfenstein. The New Order is actually a sequel to this game. That said, it may be hard to find now as it was actually published by Activision rather than Bethesda and they're prolly regretting letting that IP go. The game itself is also not quite as good as the others, even with some unique ideas.

The best is honestly Wolfenstein: The New Order. It does a good job helping players who didn't get into the other games while still being a blast to play. I think it sort of got helped by basically being one of like three good games that came out in 2014 (that was a shit year for games), but it's probably the best Wolfenstein game.

Finally there's Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, which takes place between Wolfenstein (2009) and The New Order. It's basically just more of The New Order's gameplay but as a stand alone expansion prequel. Not nearly as captivating story-wise. Still fun.",2017-10-06 19:30:36,6,

There are unsavoury people everywhere but you're very unlikely to see white supremacists, neonazis and the like at a democratic party rally; the democrats haven't supported policies they've liked for at least fifty years now.

You've got to ask one question: Why have these groups only been showing up rather recently and only really at Trump-related events?

Why have they been holding more events of their own where they primarily support Trump?

Why do they say 'Hail Trump' while doing the Nazi salute?

I've *never* seen a communist at a democratic event praising Stalin, Mao or any other communist dictator that slaughtered millions.

Modern Communists disavow those people as dictators who perverted the Communist cause for their own gain. They took advantage of the massive centralisation of power and wrought great harm upon their people.

Plenty of people, myself included, would call themselves' ""gamers,"" or at least would be labeled as such by others, while not supporting/engaging in a lot of the toxicity. But growing up, we've all had more than our fair share of bullying lobbed at us for something that would broadly fall into this identity category. We've always been the weirdos, the ones who are being given dangerous ideas from games, etc. So forgive me if I'm not comfortable with a bunch of people coming in (at lot of whom I'd assume would have either been on the side of the bullies or at least a neutral party) and painting everyone like me with a broad brush when I'm already carrying those social stigmas from when I was a kid. The argument wasn't exactly framed as ""Some people who play games, as you'd expect from any population, are toxic and it'd be nice if they weren't."" It was more along the lines of ""This hobby is toxic and the men who enjoy it are all manbabies and if you don't want to be labeled one you should distance yourself from it as much as possible.""


I was in college around when GG was happening. I wasn't really involved in much of the conversation beyond just watching videos about the mess, but during my anthro class, when it came up that I liked games, my professor asked me about the whole GG situation as if I was supposed to answer for it somehow. 


It isn't good enough for me to just leave it be and say ""oh I guess that's not me, so I don't really have to pay attention to it."" 


Honestly it's late and I don't know where I was going with this. I just don't like the idea of a bunch of ""normal/socially acceptable"" people coming into the only refuge I had from people like them as a kid, then punching down at their former bully targets and acting like they're punching up at their idea of the white male patriarchy.

It has since evolved into the whole ""anti-SJW"" thing it is now...but originally it wasn't anything even related to that.

Funny  thing is, ethics in games journalism is still a huge problem, but Gamergate's evolution into what it is now steered the discussion away from that. But it may be for the best since the initial  reasons for gamergate were based on lies told by a malicious ex. ",2017-10-06 20:53:14,-3,

That the people who try to protect different religions are a bit less like the nazis than the group who paints muslims as evil, who say that muslims are trying to immigrate into western society so that they can eventually seize power here. Who paint muslims as a religion that is incompatible with our society, that we must keep out the muslims, or even deport them. (Hmm, sounds vaguely familiar, I don't know why...)

We'll spend most if not all of our free time regurgitating bullshit to produce fictional stereotypes all to hide our own terrible insecurities.

The First Klan, established following the Civil War, was fairly large. They claimed to have over 500,000 members. However, the organisation was very disorganised and autonomous, and was largely used to settle local disputes rather than promote a specific platform. In 1870, however, the KKK was designated a terrorist organisation, and gradually fell out of favour.

The Second Klan, established following the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation, was much larger. By 1924 they had between 1.5-4 million members, which was 4-15% of the eligible population (white protestants). The Second Klan was much more organised. However, into the late 1920s and early 1930s, they fell out of favour again due to internal leadership controversies.

Video games are fundamentally an interactive medium, unlike books, TV, movies, film, and most other forms of art which are passive mediums. In that way, a video game is more like a toy. It has mechanics which you play with. The game's story justifies the mechanics and decorates its conditions for success and failure in an accessible way. In Mario: you go right, jumping pitfalls, and stomp goombas, so you can beat Bowser and rescue Peach. It's so pure, and so successful.

8826,,sapphon,"Carmack tried to redefine 'game' as 'arcade game' because during his time they were close enough, and games with stories could be dismissed as interactive novels (i.e. not real games, i.e. No True Scotsman fallacy)

I think thinking about them hierarchically (i.e. one's primary and one's secondary) is probably just wrong.  This example will get long, I'm afraid.

Shadowrun Hong Kong's epilogue is a roleplaying game about a privatized [used future](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture) in which corporations control all aspects of most people's lives.  It's a really typical and unimaginative RPG in a lot of ways: you have a party, its members have roles, they're aided in those roles by skills, items, and weapons...etc.  These skills might help in combat, or conversation, or in technical endeavors, etc. Par.  For.  The.  Fucking.  Course.

So in this game, just like in Mass Effect or your favorite recent RPG, solutions are usually smashed over the player's head like a Ming vase.  If your character has the skills or items to be Smart About Something, you get the added button in a dialog to Use That Skill and Do The Smart Thing.  Charisma lets you charm people, Strength lets you intimidate them.  Having the same high skills they do lets you engage in shop-talk, which can be revealing.  You don't have to make a plan ahead of time, though.  The game will show you the way.

Cue the mission 'Detention', which hearkened back to 20th-century RPG tradition - let the player think of it, then let the character execute it.  If the player's not thinking, what is he doing back there?  It also infuriated a lot of people - [this is](http://www.popmatters.com/review/shadowrun-hong-kong-shadows-of-hong-kong/) the top Google result for 'shadowrun hong kong epilogue' =P

You're presented with waves of enemies you probably can't defeat.  There's no button you can press, item you can use, or Clever Conversational Zinger you can use to change these facts.  

If you're used to WRPGs and being able to Find The Hidden McGuffin to Make the Combat Easier you're just in trouble.  If you're used to JRPGs and Boss Fights and fight as hard as you can, using all your consumables... *you're still going down*.

The only way to win is to have a realization *about the game's story*.  Spoilers follow.

Remember I said the game was about a privatized future?  Government is extremely weak, and corps have no reasons to keep their feuds quiet if they feel they have enough to gain.  The enemies are from *two different corporations* who each want what you have. They hate each other, and if they can't find you, they'll fight amongst themselves.  All you have to do is kill a few directly in your way, then step towards a secluded area of the map and grab your popcorn.

This little trick on the devs' part wouldn't be possible if people weren't used to story taking a back seat to mechanics, I agree. However, that means it feels even better when story and gameplay interact together to make a more believable world that the player needs to engage with as more than just 'a video game' to succeed.",2017-08-26 19:12:38,1,249.0

There is a positive correlation between times of racial tension and the erection of civil war memorials, they are used as assertions of white superiority and identification with the aims of the civil war.

The belief that people should be denied personhood for any reason, but in this instance based on race, is abhorrent. There is a thin line between white nationalism and nazism.

There is no historical revisionism in removing statues; statues are not the only medium through which history is taught. In a sense, we could regard the statues as themselves being historically revisionist by lionising people who fought to continue to enslave black people.

The problem with the ""free speech"" thing is that we don't allow many other groups to protest freely or freely express their views, because those views are abhorrent to our society. Paedophiles for example, have attempted to form organisations and do protests and lobby and so on (esp. in the 1970s through 1980s). Other groups advocating violent overthrow of the government, for example, are not allowed. You might try and claim legality is the issue, but that's clearly not the case, as many groups are in fact allowed to protest for stuff that's illegal. In the end, neo-nazis are generally advocating for hatred and there's no real upside to letting them protest. Many societies draw the line in a different place to the US, too, without apparently becoming horrible dictatorships (in fact, some are arguably more free than the US).

I would strongly suggest that making neo-nazis very afraid to say that they are neo-nazis is a pretty good way to keep ""the movement"" suppressed.",2017-08-26 22:55:20,10,434.0

As for ""I'm going to dress up as a Nazi to annoy people who say I'm a Nazi!"", I mean, these people are older then ten years old (at least physically), so they know that's not how the world works. If you dress up as a Nazi and go support a bunch of Nazis, de facto, you are a Nazi, even if you don't really buy the ideology (I'm sure many Nazi party members in the Third Reich didn't even buy the ideology - in fact we know that's the case).

I mean, if you support even mildly socialist policies, like slightly higher tax rates on the rich (I'm talking 1-5% higher, too, not 50% higher or the like), you get called a communist. Over and over and over again. Yet Berniebros don't all dress up like Stalin and the Red Army, nor do they go to actual Communist get-together and go ""FUCK YEAH COMMUNISM! ironically of course..."".

> Why isn't it okay to call both bad? 

Where did I say it wasn't? We know violence is bad and we know there is violence on both sides; however, one side is composed of Nazis and the other with people opposing Nazis. Frankly, I think calling counter protesters AntiFa, regardless of whether they're violent or not, is incorrect. The counter protesters are mostly just that: people protesting the Nazis.

Because, quite simply, when it comes to Nazis: ""both are bad"" isn't enough of a sentiment. Unfortunately, it's a common tactic within the Alt-Right: equivocate as a smokescreen. But it really shouldn't be difficult to say: ""violence on both sides is bad, but more importantly, Nazis are awful.""

Because people were waving their flag, and the ""Kekistan"" aesthetic is a blatant homage to it. If they aren't actually Nazis, they're definitely trying to be.

Because we're not trying to apply the label in terms of governance. Given the advent of Neo-Nazis, I'd say that Neo-Nazi = Nazi = White Supremacist is a reasonable transitive assumption. 

> Even if you wanted to apply a uniformly negative label, ""white supremacist"" would be more accurate.

OK? Assuming you're correct, that's a pointlessly semantic victory. But you aren't because, like I said, the Alt-Right movement is intentionally and quite flagrantly waving Nazi iconography.

I take it you're unaware of the period of history I'm referring to, then?

The paedophile movement specifically attempted to piggy-back off gay rights, and specifically used the reasoning that if gay rights were okay, so was paedophilia (ironically, this is the same reasoning the most hateful elements of the right use to oppose gay rights).

At the same time as this was going on, homosexuality was listed as a mental disorder, and indeed was well into the 1980s or possibly even 1990s, if I remember correctly. That was kind of a separate fight.

I'm jewish, and even I recognize that free speech protections weren't designed to protect popular speech.

Let the nazis have their demonstrations. Let there be counter demonstrations. But don't try to beat, literally or figuratively, the other side into accepting your position. It literally never works, and has never worked.

This is a naive sentiment, I would suggest, because you're assuming beliefs like these are rationally held and capable of ""truthful examination"" and worthy of ""public debate"", even though they are deeply harmful. The fact is, neo-nazi-type beliefs, just like eugenic beliefs, were completely irrational, and protected by a veil of pseudo-scientific or psuedo-rational nonsense, but that veil was thick enough that many members of the public and even a lot of well-educated people, could not penetrate it. Certainly the people buying into it were no more possible to reason with than Sandy Hook deniers or Chemtrail idiots.

I would add that a particularly bad problem today, one that exacerbates these issues so severely that perhaps, were it not the case, I would agree with your position, is this idea of ""fair and balanced reporting"", where we have to give ""both sides"" equal time and opportunity to express their position. This is appalling, frankly, on a variety of levels.

First off, it pre-supposes there are ""sides"", destroying nuance, destroying shades of opinion, and promoting extreme beliefs.

Second off, it gives a false equivalence between positions, which misleads and confuses many people, including some intelligent people. A person who holds a completely irrational and baseless belief, perhaps even one that is paranoid and literally insane, should not be treated as an equal to someone with a solidly reasonable, rational or well-evidence scientific position. Yet they are, constantly.

Well, I had more to say but I've lost my train of thought. I believe that the reality is, though, as a society, we need to be able to actually have debates be resolved if we want to be able to move forwards any further (rather than being some dodgy neoliberal society for the rest of eternity). Continually allowing the right (and it is always the right) to re-open issues that should have been resolved fifty, a hundred, or even five hundred+ years ago is hugely damaging to society and progress. Identity politics being so prevalent in the US, and dominating much of the political conversation (esp. on the left) is the product not of the left obsessing about this stuff (though it does, at times), but rather the right continually attempting to set back really simple, straightforward issues like ""racism is bad"" or ""homosexuals should not be victimised"". No amount of ""rational debate"" is going to convince a bunch of ""bible-believing"" (i.e. New Testament-ignoring) quasi-Christian state senators and congressmen that it's okay to be gay. Only force or the threat of force stops such people and policies - usually political, judicial, or economic force rather than physical force, thankfully. 

I do understand the concerns re: other groups being affected, but you yourself suggested West Germany dealt with neo-nazism well (or seemed to, correct me if I'm wrong), and I think so long as care is exercised, banning certain abhorrent ideas from the public sphere is not outrageous or certain to lead to dictatorships or oppression - especially not as compared to certain other ideas (like untrammeled state invasion of private conversation, which both the left and right gleefully support - only uni-directionally, of course, with the state able to examine all private conversations, but citizens unable to examine the workings of the state and their supposed representatives).",2017-08-27 15:25:02,1,542.0

I would agree 100%. Expressing Nazi ideology, engaging in Nazi or neo-nazi activities, owning Nazi memorabilia/uniforms etc., and so on were strictly illegal in West Germany and still are in the unified Germany. You could, and still can, and people do, go to jail for expressing those kinds of beliefs. Whereas East Germany had terrifying secret police and secret courts and people being disappeared and so on for anyone who disagreed with the state, which was much more extreme and downright horrifying and monstrous (and, ironically, not far from the Nazis...).

Whereas the US have always seen those things as just fine. Honestly, pre-WW2, if it wasn't for Roosevelt's leadership (if, say, he'd died early), the US could have ended up as a full-on fascist state. Even post WW2, when in Europe Nazi ideology in all aspects was seen as debunked and defunct, Nazi-esque stuff continued on in the US - insane eugenics stuff particularly.

The Confederacy, the Third Reich, and, to a lesser extent, the Jim Crow South, were horrifying, and resulted in both horrific loss of life, human rights violations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.  In fact, that's where the term ""Crimes against Humanity"" came from; the Nurmburg Trails, where the few surviving members of the Nazi leadership were put to a fair trail.  Which was far more than they ever gave their victims.  The US was very forgiving of the Confederacy, mass pardoning the traitors after the 1870s.  The rule of law instituted by these ex-Confeds resulted in the Jim Crow South, where lynchings and murders of innocent people were common, just for the amount of melanin in their skin.


I really hope I don't need to bring up the Holocaust, either.


Nazism had it's day in the sun, and that day was bloody, a monument to pure evil.  And in a real sense, the terror of white supremacists never fully ended in the US.



>Nazis killed at a higher rate but had an order of magnitude lower body count than the russians or chinese.

Well, using your own arguments, it's because Stalin's Russia lasted over twice as long as Hitler's Germany.  Mao's the same thing, far more time to gather up a bodycount.

>Dont know what this is, im simply saying pretending that the few american white supremacists threats should be taken as an extension of actual nazis is silly

What's the harm in taking their threat to American lives seriously.  It's like seeing a deadly disease pop up, like the bubonic plague.  You would think it had been cosigned to ancient history.  Simply seeing it again, even if it's relatively small, means something is horribly wrong.

For Suez, the primary perpetrators of the crisis were France and the U.K. For the Cuban Missle crisis, the argument is that the missiles were a reaction to the placement of US missiles on nations that bordered the USSR (one of the stipulations of the agreement between the USA and USSR that ended the crisis was that the US had to remove the missiles placed in Turkey).

Well, that doesn't make their actions during protests much different than the white nationalists.  I think that peaceful protests are much more effective at getting what you want, anyway, so long as there's a concentrated, sustained effort.  A lot of these right-wingers are hungry for violence, so the best thing to do is to not start any fights, even if only for pragmatic purposes.

This is particularly true with racism. The far-right (and even your president) frequently express *wildly racist* opinions. Obviously racist opinions. Yet when some mild or moderate leftist says ""that's a wildly racist sentiment"", you have people shrieking and ripping out their hair about ""FREE SPEECH!"" and how it's being destroyed. I take it you support the right to flatly call hate speech, hate speech and racists, racists?

a) Most counter-protestors are most definitely not Antifa, through antifa people may join the protests or organize a protest. 

b) Antifascism traditionally dates back to around Germany before Hitler took power, when the fascist movements were on their sunrise. Antifa is traditionally a weird coalition between anarchists, socialists, communists (and practically, probably some left liberals) etc with the goal to hampen reactionary efforts. In my area for example, they are currectly organizing to protect a sit-in by immigrants against a Nazi/Nationalist counter rally. 

You can find all sorts of people withhin an antifa group, but they will most likely be anti-capitalists (the classic red and black antifa symbol symbolizes the alliance between the anarchist section and the marxist section)

c) The most important point: Antifa doesn't have ""leadership"". It's a very autonomous method of organization - fascist things are planned, antifa start to spread it around on their social  medias groups for awareness, and then they group up and show up to hampen the fascists. 
If you see anything like "" Antifa Texas"" proclaiming something, or whatever else that pretends to be an official Antifa account - disregard it as a most likely fake. That's not how it is organized.

There are clearly a *lot* of people who commit pedophilic acts who do not ""broken brains"" as it were. Sleazy, creepy, opportunistic people (mostly men, for obvious reasons, but otherwise they can be rich or poor, black or white, Christian or Muslim or whatever - though being a religious fundamentalist - of any religion - seems to make it WAY more likely), who take advantage of the fact that kids are vulnerable to abuse them, because they're unable to easily abuse adults, because they're not vulnerable in the same way. These people *aren't* born with some kind on inescapable compulsion. They're not living their lives in fear - except for of any crimes they've committed. So I would be cautious in advancing a ""they just can't help it!"" defence too widely. There are others who, often due to abuse they themselves suffered a very young age, have serious mental problems and compulsions and indeed need help and caring. I don't think there's ANY evidence to support the idea that anyone is a ""born pedophile"". I've never seen a study that supports that. There's no animal analogy (unlike with homosexuality, where there's clear evidence that some people are ""born gay"" - and the same applies to some fraction of animals, particularly mammals), either, that I'm aware of.

You basically just have these two groups: opportunists/predators, and victims of abuse (obviously there's considerable crossover too). I'm pretty sure the former group is the larger one, too. Should people be able to seek help? Yes absolutely. If they have dangerous or upsetting impulses of any kind (not just of these kinds), they should be encouraged to seek help, and not horribly stigmatized if they get help before hurting people or committing crimes. We should have a strong mental health system ready and waiting to help them. In the UK, we do have a decent one - it needs improvement, but it does deal with precisely this kind of thing. In the US, that's not really case, nor is likely to be until mental health issues become destigmatized, which won't happen until the US becomes less religious, and less individualistic, neither of which is going to happen any time soon.

Should they be allowed to speak out in favour of abusing children? I'm going to say a very firm no on that one. They should be prevented from doing so. They are advocating for vile crimes.

Or the Confederate Constitution, was was extremely similar to the US Constitution, but with an amendment for slavery added. Or that slavery was the most pressing issue in the US for the better part of a decade before the outbreak of the war. Such an issue in fact, that there was an armed essentially border war between pro- and anti-slavery factions in Kansas before the outbreak of war. Or how the South first threatened to secede when the staunchly anti-slavery Republican party was formed. Or how armed Union troops had to remain in the South to try and suppress attacks against freed blacks and their white supporters after the war. Or how after Reconstruction Jim Crow laws were enacted that basically reinstitutionalized slavery in the South, but under a different name. No historian worth their salt is going to say that the war was over states' rights; that's entirely a piece of revisionist history from the South after the war. The evidence pretty much all points to the war being over slavery. This isn't a discussion, this isn't a personal opinion, it's hard fact.",2017-08-27 05:45:04,1,677.0

In the 19th century, capitalists abused and exploited India, Asia, and Africa. They starved and killed millions for their own benefit. British industry was built off of slave labor in the first half of the 19th century. So no, this is not easy. Because it led to the abolishment of serfdom and peasantry in England itself, but it led to slavery, starvation, murder, oppression, and imperialism  in other parts of the world. Capitalism is anything but simple - morally or economically. 

We can argue that yes, maybe billions would've lived in squalor if capitalism didn't exist. I don't disagree, but there's a class of people who live in luxury while others starve (and I don't discount myself - I'm a part of the 2% globally, which makes me poor in America but still better off than the vast majority of others). I've read convincing arguments that capitalist mindsets led to the abolition of slavery. I'm not blind to the good capitalism has done. However, there are still billions living in squalor, who are oppressed, hated, starving, in pain, and dying. We have the resources and technology to make sure that no one starves. Capitalism, for all the good it's done, has committed grave evils, too. Mass starvation and abuses for profit have occurred. For all the evil people like Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and others have committed, their sins are nothing compared to people like Leopold the Second, who abused millions of Africans for his own profit. 

This is hard. It's very hard. History is hard. And frankly, as the west has to contend with a rising Asia and India, we're going to need to answer for these sins. We've done evil to these places, especially Britain and France. Living in ignorance will not help us. It is not a solution. It is time to see that we need to admit to our sins and work to create a better world where no one starves, where everyone has a home, where people can find decent work. That, I think, is the promise of socialism. That, I think, is what socialists need to work towards. Because most things are socially constructed, things that we learn. We can change what we learn.

>so I don't really know the whole culture around the Confederacy and what not as I'm not even from the Northeast either.

Well, I can help you there! 

I won't go over too in-depth on the Confederacy here, except to say they were secessionists who wanted to break away from the Union to preserve their state's rights to own a specific group of people and treat them as property.

After the war, as a result of Reconstruction policies prohibiting those who served with the Confederacy from holding office, there were very few Confederate monuments.  No less a man than Robert E. Lee himself, said that the Confederacy should remain dead and buried, and that creating monuments to the Confederacy would simply stir up old tensions.  It wasn't until after Reconstruction that you started seeing a brief resurgence of Confederate iconography.  This didn't really pick up steam, however, until during the Jim Crow era of the South, where, with the fading of the memory of the Civil War, Southern historians and groups like Daughters of the Confederacy sought to repaint the war as a glorious ""Lost Cause"".  Not surprisingly, this also coincided with a resurgence in the KKK, which became a massive organization numbering in the tens of millions, in a time where the US population was less than 150 million.  Imagine a country where 10% of the population was a member of the KKK!  This is when the first wave of Confederate monuments was built.  This was big business at the time, as monuments were manufactured and spread all over the South.

The second wave I know less about the details, but it was in direct reaction to the Civil Rights movement, essentially serving to try and remind black people in the South, ""Remember who's really in charge"".  The one in Charlottesville is an example of Confederate monument manufacturing during that time.  

None of the Confederate monuments around today date to during the time of the Confederacy and were manufactured afterward, to spread a mythological idea of a noble Lost Cause, as well as to earn money for neo-Confederate groups.

As for ""honoring his ancestors"", choosing to identify with, plainly speaking, traitors who tried to destroy the United States so they could keep men, women, and children enslaved makes as much sense as a German identifying with the Third Reich.

And if you say it's a ""free speech"" issue, you'll notice that there are no Nazi monuments in Germany, and that country seems to be doing just fine.

And yes, there was starvation, disease, oppression, and murder. But that's a function of hierarchy that we should all look to destroy. Imperialism added a profit motive for the British.

Capitalism and the state are closely tied. The modern ""capitalist"" state is just called a liberal democracy.

The modern state wouldn't exist without capitalists pushing it, giving it more power over people to enforce things we take for granted like certain ideas about property rights.

But hey, you're still ""free"" because you're choosing to sell your labor to me. Also if you don't, you starve. But hey, that's freedom!

The modern state has been touched by socialism in a variety of ways. 

Besides, how well the government protects peoples' health is questionable. After all, if there's no regulations against dumping toxic industrial waste into the rivers, or they're not enforced, or a major political party that controls all three branches of government just decides that healthy drinking water isn't important, or that climate change isn't a threat then nothing's gonna be done. After all, there is no ""right"" to healthy drinking water. There is no ""right"" to know what's in your food. There aren't many ""rights."" The protections for the vast majority of people (who are easy to bully as individuals because corporations are very powerful, rich, and have interests that go against their own) are laws that were passed against the will of the rich and powerful, because there was popular demand and outrage. Because the state didn't exist for them in the early 20th century. It existed for the rich and powerful. There have been changes, yes, but that core's still there. ",2017-08-29 10:19:59,1,721.0

To be fair, it irritates me just as much when socjus insists everything they do is justified so long as the proper progressive stack math is employed, but anyway. The statues being torn down were largely erected as political messaging during the civil rights movements, an argument could be made that at least some of those monuments are more propaganda than honoring history. I think a discussion on whether each individual statue deserves it's place can be had, but pointing to an example that is clearly wrong does not equate to an argument that removing statues of historical figures is never the right thing to do. I'd be inclined to believe that you wouldn't argue that the statues of Saddam that were torn down was the wrong call?

I think really it should be taken as a point of discussion as opposed to a blanket presumption that all statues erected to honor historical figures are sacred. I believe in erring towards caution, prior to recent events I would have said it best to update instead of destroy them, but after Charlottesville it's almost more a question of making sure that the kind of violent protest aligned with the KKK and Nazis will only achieve the opposite result.

Being President is harder than it looks, and you have to do things like negotiate, deal with crisises as they pop up, etc.  Obama, as President, chose to focus more on helping prevent the US economy from sliding into another Great Depression, and give healthcare to millions of Americans.  He succeeded in both, but at the cost of his party losing the 2010 midterms, and eliminating the majority needed to effectively govern.

That goes against the ""my shit doesn't stink"" narrative. Because I can assure you someone in China has died for your phone - same with me because there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. The reason people have died for your car is that labor standards in the West changed, which is why manufacturing companies advocated for certain policies that let them move into countries like China. 

Oh, and please, ask people in ""communist"" countries what they think about the old regime and the one they live under now. Because I can tell you that communism, for all its flaws, did some good. It enabled mass upward mobility in societies like the Soviet Union because it ensured education for everyone. And yes, the Soviet Union was flawed, but frankly given its hectic early 20th century, there are much worse outcomes post-Stalin. The same can be said for China. Millions, if not billions, of people who had no hope or chances under older regimes were given opportunities that they never would've had otherwise under other authoritarian regimes like Imperial Russia. No, it wasn't perfect. You'll find plenty of anti-communists, but pretending like it's done nothing good is, again, just ignoring history. 

Edit: Like, there was a reason communism was popular in the 20th century. There were reasons it died down too. There are always critiques that can be made, but acting like it has no value, like it's contributed nothing, like capitalism's innocent is just ignorant.

What's misleading about it? American slavery fed the textile industry in Britain. During the civil war, the British textile industries collapsed because they didn't have enough cotton. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, were out of work because of the American Civil War. This was the era of the industrial revolution. British industry was built on American slavery. Then, after the war, the British used India as its main cotton growing hub. They displaced traditional forms of agriculture like growing food for cotton production. Millions starved. (*Empire of Cotton*, *The Half Has Never Been Told* and *Late Victorian Holocausts* all cover this pretty well - *The Half Has Never Been Told* does a great job at expressing the economics of slavery in particular, while *Empire of Cotton* does a great job stringing a broader historical narrative together. Both are by academic historians. *Late Victorian Holocausts* is just beautifully well written, amazingly well researched, and addresses how British attitudes and behaviors in India led to millions dying through starvation) 

>Also saying that your only options are to either work for someone else or starve is a false assertion.

I mean, I guess you can be a subsistence farmer. But you're either working, an owner, or starving. And not everyone can be an owner. So no, it's not a false assertion. It's just an unpleasant one. 

>No one here said capitalism is perfect, nor cannot be improved, but history has already proven communism to be a complete and abject failure, there's no reason to defend it in this day and age.

There's plenty of reason to defend it. What failed about universal education? What failed about food and safety regulation standards? What failed about improving lives for workers? Yes, the Soviet states didn't work out, but they weren't exactly communist. They embody one vision of socialism that, I agree, failed. But one vision isn't everything. Why don't we talk about authoritarian capitalists states like Chile? Argentina, maybe? Or why don't we talk about the failure of capitalism and liberal democracy in Russia post-1991? Jesus, it was a massive decline in wealth, living standards, and life expectancy. I don't even know if the Russian economy's recovered to where it was. There are plenty examples of capitalism failing too. But no one would say that discredits the whole project.

And don't mistake me for praising the Soviet states. I have a very different vision that is more socially libertarian, one that conflicts with Soviet ideology. But you just don't seem to have much of an idea about socialism, communism, capitalism, or the history or philosophy behind any of it, so I don't see why (or how) I can express it.",2017-08-29 15:01:55,0,757.0

Capitalists might have benefited from slavery in the past, but the system does not create nor require slavery to function.

Capitalism needed slavery to take off. I'm sorry, but facts don't care about your feelings. If you want to point to communism's failures as having mass killings then you need to accept that capitalism's failures including slavery. Because like it or not, it happened. It was critical to the process of developing capitalism. Imperialism came after because capitalists still needed resources, but they couldn't get them cheaply or in the quantity needed from Americans. So they turned to India. They turned to Africa. They turned to Asia. They broke down, beat, abused, and killed people for profit. They caused mass starvation because they forced people to grow cotton instead of food, then refused to import any food to help when famine came. They then justified it using racial theories.  

>That's not an example, it's hardly a sentence.

Not really. People are paid, after all. The goal was that everyone would have a job. It eventually turned into ""you're not allowed to not work if you're able,"" but given the choice between starvation and working for the government (a real problem for people, especially in the late 19th and early 20th century), what would you chose? Yes, people who didn't want to work were considered delinquents. In the U.S., we're happy to just call them lazy and say they deserve to be homeless, even if they have a mental illness that prevents them from holding a stable job. No one was threatened with death for not working though except maybe during WWII which, faced with what the Soviet Union was faced with, any nation would do the same. 

Certainly the Soviet Union employed slave labor through the gulags. Most people sent there didn't deserve it. They were soldiers who were captured or political dissidents. It was wrong and horrific. But that's very different from ""everyone who's able must have a job."" 

>There's nothing about colonial that's unique with capitalism that wouldn't have happened if they were Marxists. In fact, it probably would have been 100x worse if they had been.

Yes, the extraction of resources for European industry has nothing to do with capitalism. That's 100% correct. Again, it's clear you don't know history or Marxism, especially considering Marxist-Leninism is explicitly anti-imperialist. It's almost like anti-imperialism the reason it was popular in China and Vietnam, in Africa, in Latin America. 

>Yes, it turns out being an owner, or a self made man, isn't actually that hard!

So everyone can be a self-made man? There's no need for workers, then? Just one person can do everything in a business?  Wow, that's really impressive. I can't believe Walmart's run by just one person who does all the jobs there. 

>Finally, despite all your claims and the claims of Marxists, communism doesn't actually care about the lower class, or the poor. In fact saying so is such a bald faced lie when faced with the fact that these are always the first peyote to have their freedoms stripped away from them under communist rule, while (surprise surprise!) The rich elites still sit high and dry.

Eh. Debatable. The Soviet Union was a technocracy. It didn't matter if someone was born ""poor,"" i.e. to subsistence farmers. They were given the opportunity to go to college and become engineers and move up the ranks in society. Certainly, the Soviet Union did some horrible things to ""kulaks"" or richer peasants. I won't deny it. Stalin was a horrible person. He's the antithesis of everything I support. But I don't know why you're so stuck on the Soviet Union or China as the only visions of communism. There's an ideological continuity there because the Soviet Union supported communist revolutions, and they had a way of going about it. They didn't like groups who broke from their vision. They crushed anarchist communes in Ukraine, for example, because they didn't like challenges to their vision of communism. There were places like Yugoslavia that were communist and not in the Soviet sphere of influence. 

And yeah, there were rich elites. In China, it happened because they adopted a more capitalist approach. In the Soviet Union, it happened because Stalin killed off anyone who could lead after him, leading to an inner-circle who just promoted themselves. When a younger man reached power, i.e. Gorbachev, loans taken during the 80's in Eastern European countries led to massive debt problems there. He wanted reformed, but it failed because the Soviet Union could not afford to subsidize those countries. The economic problems led to a pretty peaceful revolution (led by Yeltsin) who declared a Russian republic. The economy policies embraced after completely destroyed life in Russia because the elites ran off with the industry, becoming capitalists. So at the very worst, you can say that communism ends up like capitalism. And I don't disagree. After all, my vision is one of reform towards a goal where there aren't elites. I don't see why you want to just stick that to the Soviet Union and its vision. I don't deny its problems, but I don't see why the goal of a more equal world needs to be abandoned just because the Soviet Union sucked. Capitalism fuckin' sucks too. I'm not going to give up because people died. People died under capitalism, just for profit.  

Again, I can recommend some books about this subject:

*The Red Flag* is pretty good. It's about the history of communism. It's very long, but it's an evenhanded treatment of communism. It shows the upsides and downsides. It shows who liked it and who disliked it and why. It shows its failures and successes.  

*Empire of Cotton* is an amazing book about the history of capitalism. It shows how slavery and imperialism mixed to help create capitalism. I'm getting most of my info from this book. I'd seriously recommend going to check it out. 

*The Half Has Never Been Told* deals with slavery in the United States and the ways it was turned industrial, using brutal techniques to force slaves to work faster and pick more cotton.

*Late Victorian Holocausts* deals with British expansion into India and the way they used the climate and starvation to their advantage. It's also beautifully well written. 

What stuns me is that you don't think I'm aware of the mass killings or violence under communism. I am. I've studied and read about this subject. I've read about environmental issues. I've read about social issues. I've read about its failures to eliminate hierarchy (or in the S.U.'s case, how it was re-implemented). I understand all that, yet I still support trying to create a better society because giving up isn't the answer. The British certainly didn't after they lost their supply of cotton. They never said ""Welp, time to go back to the farm."" No. They found another source, they changed their industries. I don't see why socialists can't do the same. There are other ideas. There are unexplored avenues that don't even require overthrowing the state and creating revolution (the main problem with Marxist-Leninism, imo) and mass violence. I say that you don't have an imagination because you can't imagine things not turning out like they did in the Soviet Union. But frankly, I don't think that's the issue for you. Chances are, our society privileges you. You don't want to lose that. And to that, I say too bad. ",2017-08-30 19:13:57,1,768.0
